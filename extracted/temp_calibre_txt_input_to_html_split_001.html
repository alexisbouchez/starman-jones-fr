<p class="calibre1">His first watch was at eight o'clock the next morning. He ate breakfast alone and reflected happily that as a watch stander he would usually eat either before or after the passengers. He was in the control room a good twenty minutes early. Kelly glanced up and said, "Good morning, sir." Max gulped. "Er--good morning, Chief!" He caught Smythe grinning behind the computer, turned his eyes hastily away. "Fresh coffee, Mr. Jones. Will you have a cup?" Max let Kelly pour for him; while they drank Kelly quietly went over the details--acceleration schedule, position and vector, power units in use, sights taken, no special orders, etc. Noguchi relieved Smythe, and shortly before the hour Dr. Hendrix appeared. "Good morning, sir." "Good morning, Doctor." "Morning." Hendrix accepted coffee, turned to Max. "Have you relieved the officer of the watch?" "Uh, why no, sir." "Then do so. It lacks less than a minute of eight." Max turned to Kelly and shakily saluted. "I relieve you, sir." "Very well, sir." Kelly went below at once. Dr. Hendrix sat down, took out a book and started to read. Max realized with a chilly feeling that he had been pushed in, to swim or not. He took a deep breath and went over to Noguchi. "Noggy, let's get the plates ready for the middle o' watch sights." Noguchi glanced at the chronometer. "As you say, sir." "Well . . . I guess it is early. Let's take a few dopplers." "Aye aye, sir." Noguchi climbed out of the saddle where he had been loafing. Max said in a low voice, "Look, Noggy, you don't have to say 'sir' to me." Noguchi answered just as quietly. "Kelly wouldn't like it if I didn't. Better let it ride." "Oh." Max frowned. "Noggy? How does the rest of the Worry gang feel about it?" Noguchi did not pretend not to understand. He answered, "Shucks, they're all rooting for you, if you can swing it." "You're sure?" "Certain. Just as long as you don't try to make a big hairy thing out of yourself like--well, like some I could mention." The computerman added, "Maybe Kovak isn't exactly cheering. He's been having a watch of his own, you know--for the first time." "He's sore?" "Not exactly. He couldn't expect to keep it long anyhow, not with a transition coming up. He won't go out of his way to give you trouble, he'll be fair." Max made a mental note to see what he could do to swing Kovak over to his side. The two manned the dopplerscope, took readings on stars forward of vector, checked what they found by spectrostellograph, and compared both with standard plates from the chart safe. At first Max had to remember that he was in charge; then he got so interested in fussy details of measurements that he was no longer self-conscious. At last Noguchi touched his sleeve. "Pushing ten o'clock, sir. I'd better get set up." "Huh? Sure, go ahead." He reminded himself not to help Noggy; the chartsman has his prerogatives, too. But he checked the set up just as Hendrix always did, as Simes rarely did, and as Kelly sometimes did, depending on who had made it. After they had gotten the new data Max programmed the problem on paper (there being plenty of time), then called it off to Noguchi at the computer. He thumbed the book himself, there being no "numbers boy" available. The figures were as clear in his recollection as ever, but he obeyed Hendrix's injunction not to depend on memory. The result worried him. They were not "in the groove." Not that the _Asgard_ was far out, but the discrepancy was measurable. He checked what he had done, then had Noguchi run the problem again, using a different programming method. The result came out the same. Sighing, he computed the correction and started to take it to Hendrix for approval. But the Astrogator still paid no attention; he sat at the console, reading a novel from the ship's library. Max made up his mind. He went to the console and said, "Excuse me, sir. I need to get there for a moment." Hendrix got up without answering and found another seat. Max sat down and called the power room. "Control officer speaking. I intend to increase boost at eleven o'clock. Stand by for time check." Hendrix must have heard him, he thought, but the Astrogator gave no sign. Max fed in the correction, set the control chronometer to execute his wishes at eleven plus-or-minus nothing. Shortly before noon Simes showed up. Max had already written his own log, based on Noguchi's log, and had signed it "M. Jones." He had hesitated, then added "C. O. o/W." Simes went to Dr. Hendrix, saluted, and said, "Ready to relieve you, sir." Hendrix spoke his first word since eight o'clock. "He's got it." Simes looked non-plussed, then went to Max. "Ready to relieve you." Max recited off the situation data while Simes read the log and the order book. Simes interrupted him while he was still listing minor ship's data. "Okay, I relieve you. Get out of my control room, Mister." Max got out. Dr. Hendrix had already gone down. Noguchi had loitered at the foot of the ladder. He caught Max's eye, made a circle with thumb and finger and nodded. Max grinned at him, started to ask a question; he wanted to know if that discrepancy was a booby trap, intentionally left in by Kelly. Then he decided that it would not be fitting; he'd ask Kelly himself, or figure it from the records. "Thanks, Noggy." That watch turned out to be typical only in the one respect that Dr. Hendrix continued to require Max to be officer of the watch himself. He did not again keep quiet but rode Max steadily, drilling him hour after hour, requiring him to take sights and set up problems continuously, as if the _Asgard_ were actually close to transition. He did not permit Max to program on paper but forced him to pretend that time was too short and that data must immediately go into the computer, be acted on at once. Max sweated, with remote controls in each fist and with Hendrix himself acting as "numbers boy." The Astrogator kept pushing him for speed, speed, and more speed--never at the sacrifice of accuracy, for any error was unforgivable. But the goal was always greater speed. Once Max objected. "Sir, if you would let me put it right into the machine, I could cut it down a lot." Hendrix snapped, "When you have your own control room, you can do that, if you think it wise. Now you'll do it _my_ way." Occasionally Kelly would take over as his supervisor. The Chief Computerman was formal, using such phrases as, "May I suggest, sir--" or "I think I'd do it this way, sir." But once he broke out with, "Confound it, Max! Don't ever pull a dumb stunt like that!" Then he started to amend his remarks. Max grinned. "Please, Chief. For a moment you made me feel at home. Thanks." Kelly looked sheepish. "I'm tired, I guess. I could do with a smoke and some java." While they were resting Max noted that Lundy was out of earshot and said, "Chief? You know more than I'll ever learn. Why didn't _you_ buck for astrogator? Didn't you ever get a chance?" Kelly suddenly looked bleak. "I once did," he said stiffly. "Now I know my limitations." Max shut up, much embarrassed. Thereafter Kelly reverted to calling him Max whenever they were alone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max did not see Sam for more than a week after he moved up to Baker deck. Even then the encounter was chance; he ran across him outside the Purser's office. "Sam!" "Good morning, sir!" Sam drew up in a smart salute with a broad grin on his face. "Huh? 'Good morning, sir' my foot! How's it going, Sam?" "Aren't you going to return my salute? In my official capacity I can report you, you know. The Captain is very, very fussy about ship's etiquette." Max made a rude noise. "You can hold that salute until you freeze, you clown." Sam relaxed. "Kid, I've been meaning to get up and congratulate you--but every time I find you're on watch. You must live in the Worry Hole." "Pretty near. Look, I'll be off this evening until midnight. What do you say I stop down to see you?" Sam shook his head. "I'll be busy." "Busy how? You expecting a jail break? Or a riot, maybe?" Sam answered soberly, "Kid, don't get me wrong-- but you stick to your end of the ship and I'll stick to mine. No, no, keep quiet and listen. I'm as proud as if I had invented you. But you can't fraternize in crew's quarters, not even with the Chief Master-at-Arms. Not yet." "Who'll know? Who's to care?" "You know blamed well that Giordano would love to tell Kuiper that you didn't know how to behave like an officer--and Old Lady Kuiper would pass it along to the Purser. Take my advice. Have I ever thrown you a curve?" Max dropped the matter, though he badly wanted a chin with Sam. He needed to tell him that his faked record had been breached and to consult with him as to probable consequences. Of course, he considered as he returned to his stateroom, there wasn't a thing to keep him from carrying out his orginal intention of jumping ship with Sam at Nova Terra--except that it was now no longer possible to imagine it. He was an officer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were approaching the middle transition; the control room went on watch-and-watch. But still Dr. Hendrix did not take the watch; Simes and Jones alternated. The Astrogator stood every watch with Max but required him to do the work and carry the responsibility himself. Max sweated it out and learned that practice problems and study of theory were nothing like having it matter when he had no way and no time to check. You had to be _right_, every time-- and there was always doubt. When, during the last twenty-four hours, the Worry gang went on continuous watch, Max thought that Dr. Hendrix would push him aside. But he did not. Simes was pushed aside, yes, but Max took the worry seat, with Hendrix bending over him and watching everything he did, but not interfering. "Great heavens!" Max thought. "Surely he isn't going to let me make this transition? I'm not ready for it, not yet. I'll never keep up." But data was coming too fast for further worry; he had to keep processing it, see the answers, and make decisions. It was not until twenty minutes before transition that Hendrix pushed him aside without a word and took over. Max was still recovering when they burst through into a new sky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last approach-and-transition before Halcyon was much like the second. There were a couple of weeks of easy watches, headed by Simes, Jones, and Kovak, with both Kelly and Hendrix getting a little rest. Max liked it, both on and off watch. On watch he continued to practice, trying to achieve the inhuman speed of Dr. Hendrix. Off watch he slept and enjoyed himself. The Bifrost Lounge no longer terrified him. He now played three-dee with Ellie there, with Chipsie on his shoulder, giving advice. Ellie had long since waved her eyes at Captain Blaine and convinced him that a pet so well behaved, so well house-broken, and in particular so well mannered (she had trained the spider puppy to say, "Good morning, Captain," whenever it saw Blaine)--in all respects so civilized should not be forced to live in a cage. Max had even learned to swap feeble repartee with Mrs. Daigler, thinking up remarks and waiting for a chance. Ellie was threatening to teach him to dance, although he managed to stall her until resumption of watch-and-watch before transition made it impossible. Again he found himself shoved into the worry seat for the last part of the approach. This time Dr. Hendrix did not displace him until less than ten minutes before burst through.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the easy drop down to Halcyon Ellie's determination won out. Max learned to dance. He found that he liked it. He had good rhythm, did not forget her instructions, and Ellie was a fragrant, pleasant armful. "I've done all I can," she announced at last. "You're the best dancer with two left feet I've ever met." She required him to dance with Rebecca Weberbauer and with Mrs. Daigler. Mrs. Daigler wasn't so bad after all, as long as she kept her mouth shut--and Rebecca was cute. He began to look forward to the fleshpots of Halcyon, that being Ellie's stated reason for instructing him; he was to be conscripted as her escort. Only one thing marred the final leg; Sam was in trouble. Max did not find out about it until after the trouble broke. He got up early to go on watch and found Sam cleaning decks in the silent passages of passenger quarters. He was in dungarees and wearing no shield. "Sam!" Sam looked up. "Oh. Hi, kid. Keep your voice down, you'll wake people." "But Sam, what in Ned are you doing?" "Me? I seem to be manicuring this deck." "But why?" Sam leaned on his broom. "Well, kid, it's like this. The Captain and I had a difference of opinion. He won." "You've been busted?" "Your intuition is dazzling." "What happened?" "Max, the less you know about it the better. Don't fret. _Sic transit gloria mundi_--Tuesday is usually worse." "But-- See here, I've got to grab chow and go on watch. I'll look you up later." "Don't." Max got the story from Noguchi. Sam, it appeared, had set up a casino in an empty storeroom. He might have gotten away with it indefinitely had it remained a cards-and-dice set up, with a rake off for the house-- the "house" being the Chief Master-at-Arms. But Sam had added a roulette wheel and that had been his downfall; Giordano had come to suspect that the wheel had less of the element of chance than was customary in better-run gambling halls--and had voiced his suspicion to Chief Clerk Kuiper. From there events took an inevitable course. "When did he put in this wheel?" "Right after we raised from Garson's Planet." Max thought uncomfortably of the "tea cozies" he had helped Sam bring aboard there. Noguchi went on, "Uh, didn't you know, sir? I thought you and him were pretty close before--you know, before you moved up decks." Max avoided an answer and dug into the log. He found it under the previous day, added by Bennett to Simes' log. Sam was restricted to the ship for the rest of the trip, final disciplinary action postponed until return to Terra. That last seemed to mean that Captain Blaine intended to give Sam a chance to show good behavior before making his recommendation to the guilds--the Captain was a sweet old guy, he certainly was. But "restricted"? Then Sam would never get his chance to run away from whatever it was he was running away from. He located Sam as soon as he was off watch, digging him out of his bunkroom and taking him out into the corridor. Sam looked at him sourly. "I thought I told you not to look me up?" "Never mind! Sam, I'm worried about you. This 'restricted' angle . . . it means you won't have a chance to--" "_Shut up!_" It was a whisper but Max shut up. "Now look here," Sam went on, "Forget it. I got my stake and that's the important point." "But . . ." "Do you think they can seal this ship tight enough to keep me in when I decide to leave? Now stay away from me. You're teacher's pet and I want to keep it that way. I don't want you lectured about bad companions, meaning me." "But I want to help, Sam. I . . ." "Will you kindly get up above 'C' deck where you belong?" He did not see Sam again that leg; presently he stopped worrying about it. Hendrix required him to compute the planetary approach--child's play compared with a transition--then placed Max at the conn when they grounded. This was a titulary responsibility since it was precomputed and done on radar-automatic. Max sat with the controls under his hands, ready to override the autopilot--and Hendrix stood behind him, ready to override him--but there was no need; the _Asgard_ came down by the plotted curve as easy as descending stairs. The thrust beams bit in and Max reported, "Grounded, sir, on schedule." "Secure." Max spoke into the ship's announcers. "Secure power room. Secure all space details. Dirtside routine, second section." Of the four days they were there he spent the first three nominally supervising, and actually learning from, Kovak in the routine ninety-day inspection and overhaul of control room instruments. Ellie was vexed with him, as she had had different plans. But on the last day he hit dirt with her, chaperoned by Mr. and Mrs. Mendoza. It was a wonderful holiday. Compared with Terra, Halcyon is a bleak place and Bonaparte is not much of a city. Nevertheless Halcyon is an earth-type planet with breathable air, and the party from the _Asgard_ had not set foot outdoors since Earthport, months of time and unthinkable light-years behind. The season was postaphelion, midsummer, Nu Pegasi burned warm and bright in blue sky. Mr. Mendoza hired a carriage and they drove out into green, rolling countryside behind four snuffling little Halcyon ponies. There they visited a native pueblo, a great beehive structure of mud, conoid on conoid, and bought souvenirs--two of which turned out to have "Made in Japan" stamped inconspicuously on them. Their driver, Herr Eisenberg, interpreted for them. The native who sold the souvenirs kept swiveling his eyes, one after another, at Mrs. Mendoza. He twittered some remarks to the driver, who guffawed. "What does he say?" she asked. "He was complimenting you." "So? But how?" "Well . . . he says you are for a slow fire and no need for seasoning; you'd cook up nicely. And he'd do it, too," the colonist added, "if you stayed here after dark." Mrs. Mendoza gave a little scream. "You didn't tell us they were _cannibals_. Josie, take me back!" Herr Eisenberg looked horrified. "Cannibals? Oh, no, lady! They don't eat each other, they just eat us-- when they can get us, that is. But there hasn't been an incident in twenty years." "But that's worse!" "No, it isn't, lady. Look at it from their viewpoint. They're civilized. This old fellow would never break one of their laws. But to them we are just so much prime beef, unfortunately hard to catch." "Take us back at once! Why, there are hundreds of them, and only five of us." "Thousands, lady. But you are safe as long as Gneeri is shining." He gestured at Nu Pegasi. "It's bad juju to kill meat during daylight. The spirit stays around to haunt." Despite his reassurances the party started back. Max noticed that Eldreth had been unfrightened. He himself had wondered what had kept the natives from tying them up until dark. They dined at the Josephine, Bonaparte's best (and only) hotel. But there was a real three-piece orchestra, a dance floor, and food that was at least a welcome change from the menus of the Bifrost Lounge. Many ship's passengers and several officers were there; it made a jolly party. Ellie made Max dance between each course. He even got up his nerve to ask Mrs. Daigler for a dance, once she came over and suggested it. During the intermission Eldreth steered him out on the adjacent balcony. There she looked up at him. "You leave that Daigler hussy alone, hear me?" "Huh? I didn't do anything." She suddenly smiled warmly. "Of course not, you big sweet ninny. But Ellie has to take care of you." She turned and leaned on the rail. Halcyon's early night had fallen, her three moons were chasing each other. The sky blazed with more stars than can be seen in Terra's lonely neighborhood. Max pointed out the strange constellations and showed her the departure direction they would take tomorrow to reach transition for Nova Terra. He had learned four new skies so far, knew them as well as he knew the one that hung over the Ozarks--and he would learn many more. He was already studying, from the charts, other skies they would be in this trip. "Oh, Max, isn't it _lovely!_" "Sure is. Say, there's a meteor. They're scarce here, mighty scarce." "Make a wish! Make a wish quick!" "Okay." He wished that he would get off easy when it came to the showdown. Then he decided that wasn't right; he ought to wish old Sam out of his jam--not that he believed in it, either way. She turned and faced him. "What did you wish?" "Huh?" He was suddenly self-conscious. "Oh, mustn't tell, that spoils it." "All right. But I'll bet you get your wish," she added softly. He thought for a moment that he could have kissed her, right then, if he had played his cards right. But the moment passed and they went inside. The feeling stayed with him on the ride back, made him elated. It was a good old world, even if there were some tough spots. Here he was, practically a junior astrogator on his first trip--and it hadn't been more than weeks since he was borrowing McAllister's mules to work the crop and going barefooted a lot to save shoes. And yet here he was in uniform, riding beside the best-dressed girl in four planets. He fingered the insignia on his chest. Marrying Ellie wasn't such an impossible idea now that he was an officer--if he ever decided to marry. Maybe her old man wouldn't consider an officer--and an astrogator at that--completely ineligible. Ellie wasn't bad; she had spunk and she played a fair game of three-dee-- most girls wouldn't even be able to learn the rules. He was still in a warm glow when they reached the ship and were hoisted in. Kelly met him at the lock. "Mr. Jones--the Captain wants to see you." "Huh? Oh. G'night, Ellie--I'll have to run." He hurried after Kelly. "What's up?" "Dr. Hendrix is dead."</p>
<p class="calibre1">13</p>
<p class="calibre1">TRANSITION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max questioned Kelly as they hurried up to the Captain's cabin. "I don't know. I just don't know, Max." Kelly seemed close to tears. "I saw him before dinner--he came into the Hole to check what you and Kovak have been doing. He seemed all right. But the Purser found him dead in his bunk, the middle of the evening." He added worriedly, "I don't know what is going to happen now." "What do you mean?" "Well . . . if I was captain, I'd lay over and send for a relief. But I don't know." For the first time Max realized that this change would make Mr. Simes the astrogator. "How long would it take to get a relief?" "Figure it out. The _Dragon_ is about three months behind us; she'd pick up our mail. A year about." In the contradictions of interstellar travel the ships themselves were the fastest method of communication; a radio message (had such a silly thing been attempted) would have taken more than two centuries to reach Earth, a like time for a reply. Max found the Captain's cabin open and crowded with officers, all standing around, saying nothing, and looking solemn; he slipped inside without announcing himself and tried to be inconspicuous. Kelly did not go in. Captain Blaine sat at his desk with head bent. Several stragglers, members of the gay party at the Josephine, arrived after Max; First Officer Walther checked them off with his eyes, then said quietly to Blaine, "Ship's officers all present, sir." Captain Blaine raised his head and Max was shocked to see how old he looked. "Gentlemen," he said in a low voice, "you know the sad news. Dr. Hendrix was found dead in his room this evening. Heart attack. The Surgeon tells me that he passed on about two hours before he was found--and that his death was probably almost painless." His voice broke, then he continued. "Brother Hendrix will be placed in his last orbit two hours after we raise ship tomorrow. That is how he would have wished it, the Galaxy was his home. He gave unstintingly of himself that men should ride safely among the stars." He paused so long that Max thought that the old man had forgotten that others were present. But when he resumed his voice was almost brisk. "That is all, gentlemen. Astrogators will please remain." Max was not sure that he counted as an astrogator but the use of the plural decided him. First Officer Walther started to leave; Blaine called him back. When the four were alone, the Captain said, "Mr. Simes, you will take over head-of-department duties at once. Mr., uh . . ."; his eyes rested on Max. "Jones, sir." "Mr. Jones will assume your routine duties, of course. This tragedy leaves you short-handed; for the rest of this trip I will stand a regular watch." Simes spoke up. "That isn't necessary, Captain. We'll make out." "Perhaps. But those are my wishes." "Aye aye, sir." "Prepare to lift on schedule. Any questions?" "No, sir." "Goodnight, gentlemen. Dutch, stay a moment, please?" Outside the door Simes started to turn away; Max stopped him. "Mr. Simes?" "Huh? Yes?" "Any instructions for me, sir?" Simes looked him over. "You stand your watch, Mister. I'll handle everything else." The next morning Max found a crepe armband on his desk and a notice from the First Officer that mourning would continue for one week. The _Asgard_ raised on schedule, with the Captain sitting quietly in his chair, with Simes at the control console. Max stood near the Captain, with nothing to do. Aside from the absence of Hendrix all was routine--except that Kelly was quite bad-tempered. Simes, Max admitted, handled the maneuver smartly--but it was precomputed, anyone could have done it; shucks, Ellie could have been sitting there. Or Chipsie. Max had the first watch. Simes left him after enjoining him not to deviate from schedule without phoning him first. An hour later Kovak relieved Max temporarily and Max hurried to the passenger lock. There were five honorary pall bearers, the Captain, Mr. Walther, Simes, Max, and Kelly. Behind them, crowding the passageways, were officers and most of the crew. Max saw no passengers. The inner door of the lock was opened; two steward's mates carried the body in and placed it against the outer door. Max was relieved to see that it had been wrapped in a shroud covering it completely. They closed the inner door and withdrew. The Captain stood facing the door, with Simes and the First Officer standing guard on one side of the door and, on the other side facing them, Max and Kelly. The Captain flung one word over his shoulder: "Pressure!" Behind stood Bennett wearing a portable phone; he relayed the word to the power room. The pressure gauge over the lock door showed one atmosphere; now it started to crawl upward. The Captain took a little book from his pocket and began to read the service for the dead. Feeling that he could not stand to listen Max watched the pressure gauge. Steadily it climbed. Max reflected that the ship had already passed escape speed for the Nu Pegasi system before he had been relieved; the body would take an open orbit. The gauge reached ten atmospheres; Captain Blaine closed his book. "Warn the passengers," he said to Bennett. Shortly the loudspeakers sounded: "All hands! All passengers! The ship will be in free fall for thirty seconds. Anchor yourselves and do not change position." Max reached behind him, found one of the many hand holds always present around an airlock and pulled down so that his grip would keep his feet in contact with the deck. A warning siren howled--then suddenly he was weightless as the ship's boost and the artificial anomalous gravity field were both cut out. He heard the Captain say loudly and firmly, "'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.' Let the body be cast forth." The pressure gauge dropped suddenly to zero and Dr. Hendrix was launched into space, there to roam the stars for all eternity. Max felt weight again as the power room brought them back to ship-normal. The pressure gauge showed gradually building pressure. People turned away and left, their voices murmuring low. Max went up and relieved the watch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following morning Simes moved into Dr. Hendrix's cabin. There was trouble with First Officer Walther about it--Max heard only third-hand reports-- but the Captain upheld Simes; he stayed in the Astrogator's quarters. The Worry Hole settled into routine not much different from what had gone before, except that Simes' personality spread through everything. There had never been a posted watch list before; Kelly had always assigned the crewmen and the Doctor had simply informed the top-watch standers orally of his wishes. Now a typed list appeared:</p>
<p class="calibre1">FIRST WATCH Randolph Simes, Astrogator SECOND WATCH Captain Blaine (M. Jones, acting apprentice, under instruction) THIRD WATCH Kelly, Ch. Cmptrmn. (_signed_) Randolph Simes, Astrogator</p>
<p class="calibre1">Below was a four-watch list for crewmen, also signed by Simes. Max looked at it and shrugged it off. It was obvious that Simes had it in for him, though he could not figure out why. It was equally obvious that Simes did not intend to let him do any astrogation and that Max's chances of being accepted in time as a fullfledged brother had now, with the death of Dr. Hendrix, sunk to zero. Unless, of course, Captain Blaine overrode Simes and forced a favorable report, which was extremely unlikely. Max again began to think of going along with Sam at Nova Terra. Well, in the meantime he'd stand his watches and try to stay out of trouble. That was that. There was only one transition to be made between Halcyon and Nova Terra, a leap of ninety-seven light-years three weeks out from Halcyon at a boost of seventeen gravities--the boost always depended on the distance from the star to the gateway, since the purpose was to arrive there just under the speed of light. The Worry Hole stayed on a watch in three for the officers and one in four for crewmen for the first two weeks. Captain Blaine showed up each watch but seemed quite willing for Max to carry out the light duties of that portion of the leg. He gave little instruction--when he did, he was likely to wander off into anecdotes, amusing but not useful. Max tried to continue his own drill, carrying out the routine middle o' watch computation as if it were the frantic matter it would have been near transition. Captain Blaine watched him, then said mildly, "Don't get yourself into a state, son. Always program on paper when possible--always. And take time to check. Hurrying causes mistakes." Max said nothing, thinking of Dr. Hendrix, but carried out the orders. At the end of his first watch under the Captain Max signed the log as usual. When Simes came on watch four hours later, Max was dug out of bed and required to report to the control room. Simes pointed to the log. "What's the idea, Mister?" "Of what, sir?" "Signing the log. You weren't officer of the watch." "Well, sir, the Captain seemed to expect it. I've signed a lot of logs and he's always approved them in the past." "Hmm-- I'll speak to the Captain. Go below." At the end of his next watch, having received no instructions, Max prepared the log and took it to the Captain. "Sir? Do you want to sign this? Or shall I?" "Eh?" Blaine looked at it. "Oh, I suppose I had better. Always let a head of department do things his own way if possible. Remember that when you are a skipper, son." He signed it. That settled it until the Captain started a habit of not being there, first for short periods, then for longer. The time came when he was absent at the end of the watch; Max phoned Mr. Simes. "Sir, the Captain isn't here. What do you want me to do?" "So what? It's his privilege to leave the control room." "But Kelly is ready to relieve and the log isn't signed. Shall I sign it? Or shall I phone him?" "Phone him? Jumping jeepers, no! Are you crazy?" "What are your orders, sir?" Simes was silent, then answered, "Print his name, then sign under it 'By direction'--and after this use your head." They changed to watch-and-watch for the last week. Max continued under the Captain; Kelly assisted Simes. Once the shift was made Blaine became meticulous about being present in the control room and, when Max started to make the first computation, gently pushed him aside. "I had better take over, lad. We're getting closer now." So Max assisted him--and became horrifyingly aware that the Captain was not the man he must once have been. His knowledge of theory was sound and he knew all the short cuts--but his mind tended to wander. Twice in one computation Max had to remind him diplomatically of details. Yet the Old Man seemed unaware of it, was quite cheerful. It went on that way. Max began to pray that the Captain would let the new Astrogator make the transition himself--much as he despised Simes. He wanted to discuss his misgivings with Kelly--there was no one else with whom it would have been possible--but Kelly was on the opposite watch with Simes. There was nothing to do but worry. When the last day arrived he discovered that Captain Blaine neither intended to take the ship through himself nor to let Simes do it; he had a system of his own. When they were all in the Worry Hole the Captain said, "I want to show you all a wrinkle that takes the strain out of astrogating. With no reflections on our dear brother, Dr. Hendrix, while he was a great astrogator, none better--nevertheless he worked too hard. Now here is a method taught me by my own master. Kelly, if you will have the remote controls led out, please." He had them seat themselves in a half circle, himself, Simes, and Max, around the saddle of the computer, with Kelly in the saddle. Each of them was armed with programming forms and Captain Blaine held the remote-control switches in his lap. "Now the idea is for us each to work a sight in succession, first me, then Mr. Simes, then Mr. Jones. That way we keep the data flowing without strain. All right, lads, start pitching. Transition stations everyone." They made a dry run, then the Captain stood up. "Call me, Mr. Simes, two hours before transition. I believe you and Mr. Jones will find that this method gives you enough rest in the meantime." "Yes, sir. But Captain--may I make a suggestion?" "Eh? Certainly, sir." "This is a fine system, but I suggest that Kelly be put in the astrogating group instead of Jones. Jones is not experienced. We can put Kovak in the saddle and Lundy on the book." Blaine shook his head. "No. Accuracy is everything, sir, so we must have our best operator at the computer. As for Mr. Jones, this is how he must get experience--if he gets rattled, you and I can always fill in for him." He started to leave, then added, "But Kovak can alternate with Kelly until I return. Mustn't have anyone getting tired, that way mistakes are made." "Aye aye, sir." Simes said nothing more to Max. They started working sights, alternately, using written programming on printed forms. The sights were coming in on a twenty-minute schedule, giving each of them forty minutes for a problem if he cared to take it. Max began to think that the Captain's method did have its points. Certainly Dr. Hendrix had worked himself to death-- ships did not wear out but men did. He had plenty of time to work not only his own problems, but those of Simes. The data came out orally and there was nothing to keep Max from programming Simes' sights in his head and checking on what went into the computer. So far as he could see Simes was doing all right--though of course there was no real strain involved, not yet. They ate sandwiches and drank coffee where they sat, leaving their seats only for five minutes or so at a time. Captain Blaine showed up twenty minutes early. He smiled and said cheerily, "Everyone happy and relaxed? Now we really get down to it. I have just time for a cup of coffee." A few minutes later he sat down and took over the control switches from Simes. The sights were coming through on a ten-minute schedule now, still ample time. Max continued to work them all, his own on paper and the others in his head. He was always through in time to catch the data for the next sight, program it mentally and check translations as Lundy thumbed the book. It gave him a running picture of how closely they were in the groove, how much hunting they were having to do in approaching their invisible target. It seemed to him that Simes tended to over-correct and that the Captain was somewhat optimistically under-correcting, but neither was so far out as to endanger the ship. Maybe he was wrong about the Captain--the Old Man seemed to steady down when it mattered. His own corrections, he was glad to see, the Captain applied without question. After more than an hour with transition forty-five. minutes away Captain Blaine looked up and said, "All right, boys, we're getting close. Slam them to us as fast as you can now." Smythe and Kovak, with Noguchi and Bennett running for them, slipped into high gear; data poured out in a steady stream. Max continued to work every sight, programming his own in his head and calling off figures faster than he wrote them down. He noticed that Simes was sweating, sometimes erasing and starting over. But the figures Simes called out agreed with what Max thought they should be, from his own mental programming. Captain Blaine seemed relaxed, though he had not speeded up materially and sometimes was still using the computer when Max was ready to pour his sight into it. At one point Simes spoke too rapidly, slurring his figures, Lundy promptly said, "Repeat, sir!" "Confound it! Clean out your ears!" But Simes repeated. The Captain glanced up, then bent back to his own problem. As soon as the computer was free Captain Blaine called his own figures to Lundy. Max had already set up the Captain's sight in his mind, was subconsciously listening while watching Simes. An alarm bell rang in his mind. "Captain! I don't check you!" Captain Blaine stopped. "Eh?" "That program is wrong, sir." The Captain did not seem angry. He simply handed his programming board to Simes. "Check me, sir." Simes glanced quickly at the figures. "I check you, sir!" Blaine said, "Drop out, Jones. Mr. Simes and I will finish." "But--" "Drop out, Mister!" Max got out of the circle, seething inside. Simes' check of the Captain's set up hadn't meant anything, unless Simes had listened to and remembered (as Max had) the data as it came in. The Captain had transposed an eight and a three in the fifth and sixth decimal places--the set up would look okay unless one knew the correct figures. If Simes had even bothered to check it, he added bitterly. But Max could not keep from noting and processing the data in his mind. Simes' next sight should catch the Captain's error; his correction should repair it. It would be a big correction, Max knew; traveling just under the speed of light the ship clipped a million miles in less than six seconds. Max could see Simes hesitate as the lights from his next sight popped up on the computer and Lundy translated them back. Why, the man looked frightened! The correction called for would push the ship extremely close to critical speed--Simes paused, then ordered less than half the amount that Max believed was needed. Blaine applied it and went on with his next problem. When the answer came out the error, multiplied by time and unthinkable velocity, was more glaring than ever. The Captain threw Simes a glance of astonishment, then promptly made a correction. Max could not tell what it was, since it was done without words by means of the switch in his lap. Simes licked the dryness from his lips. "Captain?" "Time for just one more sight," Blaine answered. "I'll take it myself, Mr. Simes." The data were passed to him, he started to lay his problem out on the form. Max saw him erase, then look up; Max followed his gaze. The pre-set on the chronometer above the computer showed the seconds trickling away. "Stand by!" Blaine announced. Max looked up. The stars were doing the crawling together that marked the last moments before transition. Captain Blaine must have pressed the second switch, the one that would kick them over, while Max was watching, for the stars suddenly blinked out and were replaced instantaneously by another starry firmament, normal in appearance. The Captain lounged back, looked up. "Well," he said happily, "I see we made it again." He got up and headed for the hatch, saying over his shoulder, "Call me when you have laid us in the groove, Mr. Simes." He disappeared down the hatch. Max looked up again, trying to recall from the charts he had studied just what piece of this new sky they were facing. Kelly was looking up, too. "Yes, we came through," Max heard him mutter. "But _where?_" Simes also had been looking at the sky. Now he swung around angrily. "What do you mean?" "What I said," Kelly insisted. "That's not any sky I ever saw before." "Nonsense, man! You just haven't oriented yourself. Everybody knows that a piece of sky can look strange when you first glance at it. Get out the flat charts for this area; we'll find our landmarks quickly enough." "They are out, sir. Noguchi." It took only minutes to convince everyone else in the control room that Kelly was right, only a little longer to convince even Simes. He finally looked up from the charts with a face greenish white. "Not a word to anybody," he said. "That's an order--and I'll bust any man who slips. Kelly, take the watch." "Aye aye, sir." "I'll be in the Captain's cabin." He went below to tell Blaine that the _Asgard_ had come out in unknown space--was lost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">14</p>
<p class="calibre1">ANYWHERE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two hours later Max climbed wearily up into the Worry Hole. He had just had a bad half hour, telling the truth as he saw it. Captain Blaine had been disinclined to blame anyone but himself, but had seemed stunned and bewildered. Simes had been nasty. His unstated logic seemed to be that, since it could not possibly be his fault and since it was unthinkable to blame the Captain, it must be Max's fault. Since Max had been relieved some minutes before transition, his theory seemed to be that Max had caused it by making a disturbance as they were approaching the critical instant--joggled their elbows, so to speak. Mr. Walther had been present, a mute judge. They spoke of matters' outside his profession; he had seemed to be studying their faces. Max had stuck doggedly to his story. He found Kelly still on watch. Kovak and Smythe were taking spectrograms; Noguchi and Lundy were busy with papers. "Want to be relieved?" he said to Kelly. Kelly looked troubled. "I'm sorry, but you can't." "Huh?" "Mr. Simes phoned while you were on your way up. He says you are not to stand duty until further notice." "He did? Well, I'm not surprised." "He also said that you were to stay out of the control room." Max made a violent statement about Simes. He added, "Well, it was nice while it lasted. Be seeing you." He turned away but Kelly stopped him. "Don't be in a hurry, Max. He won't be up for a while. I want to know what happened. From the computer I can't tell what goes on." Max told him, drawing on his memory for the figures. Kelly nodded at last. "That confirms what I've been able to dig out. The Captain flubbed with a transposition--easy to do. Then Simes didn't have the guts to make a big correction when it came around to him. But one more thing you don't know. Neither do they--yet." "Huh? What?" "The power room recorder shows it. Guenther had the watch down there and gave it to me over the phone. No, I didn't tell him anything was wrong. I just asked for the record; that's not unusual. By the way, any excitement down below? Passengers blowing their tops?" "Not when I came up." "Won't be long. They can't keep this quiet forever. Back to my story--things were already sour but the Captain had one last chance. He applied the correction and a whopping big one. But he applied it with the wrong sign, just backwards." Profanity was too weak. All Max could say was, "Oh, my!" "Yeah. Well, there's the devil to pay and him out to lunch." "Any idea where we are?" Kelly pointed to Kovak and Smythe at the spectrostellograph. "They're fishing, but no bites. Bright stars first, B-types and O's. But there is nothing that matches the catalogues so far." Noguchi and Lundy were using a hand camera. Max asked, "What are _they_ doing?" "Photographing the records. All of 'em--programming sheets, the rough data from the chartsmen, the computer tape, everything." "What good will that do?" "Maybe none. But sometimes records get lost. Sometimes they even get changed. But not this time. I'm going to have a set of my own." The unpleasant implications of Kelly's comments were sinking into Max's mind when Noguchi looked up. "That's all, Boss." "Good." Kelly turned to Max. "Do me a favor. Stick those films in your pocket and take them with you. I want them out of here. I'll pick them up later." "Well . . . all right." While Noguchi was unloading the camera Max added to Kelly, "How long do you think it will take to figure out where we are, checking spectra?" Kelly looked more troubled than ever. "Max, what makes you think there is anything to find?" "I don't follow you." "Why should anything out there . . ." He made a sweeping gesture. ". . . match up with any charts we've got here?" "You mean," Max said slowly, "that we might not be in our own galaxy at all? Maybe in another, like the Andromeda Nebula, say?" "Maybe. But that's not all. Look, Max, I'm no theoretical physicist, that's sure, but so far as I know all that theory says is that when you pass the speed of light you have to go out of your own space, somewhere else. You've become irrelevant and it won't hold you. But _where_ you go, unless you are set just right for a Horst congruency, that's another matter. The theory doesn't say. Does it?" Max's head started to ache. "Gee, I don't know." "Neither do I. But since we weren't set to duck back into our own space at another point, we may be anywhere. And I mean _anywhere_. We may be in some other space-time totally unconnected with our own." He glanced up at the strange stars. Max went below feeling worse than ever. He passed Simes going up; the Astrogator scowled at him but did not say anything. When Max reached his stateroom he put the films in a drawer--then thought about it, removed the drawer and cached them in dead space behind the drawer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max stayed in his room and worried. He fretted over being kept out of the control room, wanting very badly himself to check the sky for known stars. B- and O-type stars--well, that was all right, but there were half a dozen other ways. Globular star clusters, now-- they'd be easy to identify; snag four of them and you'd know where you were as clear as reading a street sign. Then it would be just a case of fining it down, because you'd know what to look for and where. After which you'd high-tail it for the nearest charted congruency, whether it took you a week or a year. The ship couldn't _really_ be lost. But suppose they weren't even in the right galaxy? The thought dismayed him. If that were the case, they'd never get home before the end of time. It was chased out by another thought--suppose Kelly's suspicion had been correct, that this was an entirely different universe, another system of space and time? What then? He had read enough philosophical fancies to know that there was no theoretical reason for such to be impossible; the Designer might have created an infinity of universes, perhaps all pretty much alike--or perhaps as different as cheese and Wednesday. Millions, billions of them, all side by side from a multidimensional point of view. Another universe might have different laws, a different speed of light, different gravitational ballistics, a different time rate--why they might get back to find that ten million years had passed and Earth burnt to a cinder! But the light over his desk burned steadily, his heart pumped as always, obeying familiar laws of hydraulics, his chair pressed up against him--if this was a different sort of space the differences weren't obvious. And if it _was_ a different universe, there was nothing to be done about it. A knock came at the door, he let Kelly in and gave him the chair, himself sitting on the bed. "Any news?" "No. Golly I'm tired. Got those pix?" Max took out the drawer, fished around behind it, gave them to Kelly. "Look, Chief, I got an idea." "Spill it." "Let's assume that we're in the right galaxy, because--" "Because if we ain't, there isn't any point in trying!" "Well, yes. All right, we're in the Milky Way. So we look around, make quick sample star counts and estimate the distance and direction of the center. Then we try to identify spectra of stars in that direction, after deciding what ones we ought to look for and figuring apparent magnitudes for estimated distance. That would . . ." "--save a lot of time," Kelly finished wearily. "Don't teach your grandpop how to suck eggs. What the deuce do you think I've been doing?" "Oh. Sorry." "Don't be. It's more than our revered boss thought of. While I been trying to work he's been bellyachin' around, finding fault, and trying to get me to say that he was dead right in everything--worrying about himself instead of worrying about his ship. Pfui! By the way, he grabbed the records just like I thought he would--'to show the Captain.' _He_ says." Kelly stood up. "I'd better go." "Don't rush. I'll ring for coffee." "Running out of my ears now." Kelly took the films from his pocket and looked at them dutifully. "I had Noggy make two shots of everything; this is a double set. That's a good hidey-hole you've got. What say we stick one set in there and let it cool? Never can tell." "Kelly, you aren't really expecting trouble over those records? Seems to me we've got trouble enough with the ship being lost." "Huh? Max, you're going to make a good officer some day. But you're innocent. Now I'm a suspenders _and_ belt man. I like to take as few chances as possible. Doc Hendrix--rest his soul!--was the same way." Kelly waited until Max had returned the spare set to the space back of the drawer, then started to leave. He paused. "One thing I forgot to tell you, Max. We happened to come out pretty close to a star and a G-type at that." "Oh." Max considered it. "Not one we know?" "Of course not, or I would have said so. Haven't sized it yet, but figuring normal range in the G's we could reach it in not less than four weeks, not more than a year, at high boost. Thought you'd like to know." "Well, yes. Thanks. But I can't see that it makes much difference." "No? Doesn't it seem like a good idea to have a Sol-type star, with maybe Earth-type planets around it, not far off?" "Well . . ." "It does to me. The Adam-and-Eve business is rugged at best--and we might be in for a long stay." With that he left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No steward's mate came to tell Max it was time for dinner; when he noticed that it was past time, he went to the lounge. Most of the passengers were already seated, although some were standing around talking. It was impossible to miss the feeling of unrest in the room. Max saw that the Captain was not at his table, nor was Mr. Walther at his. As he headed for his own table a Mr. Hornsby tried to grab his arm. Max shook him off. "Sorry, sir. I'm in a hurry." "Wait a minute! I want to ask you . . ." "Sorry." He hurried on and sat down. Chief Engineer Compagnon was not at the table, but the usual passengers were present. Max said, "Good evening," and reached for his soup spoon, just to keep busy. There was no soup to be toyed with, nor were there rolls and butter on the table, although it was ten minutes past the hour. Such things simply did not happen in Chief Steward Dumont's jurisdiction. Come to think about it, Dumont was not in sight. Mrs. Daigler put a hand on his arm. "Max? Tell me, dear--what is this silly rumor going around?" Max tried to maintain a poker face. "What rumor, ma'am?" "You must have heard it! After all, you're in astrogation. They say that the Captain turned the wrong corner or something and that we're falling into a star." Max tried to give a convincing chuckle. "Who told you that? Whoever it was probably couldn't tell a star from his elbow." "You wouldn't fool your Aunt Maggie?" "I can assure you positively that the _Asgard_ is not falling into a star. Not even a small star." He turned in his chair. "But it does look like something's fallen into the galley. Dinner is awfully late." He remained turned, trying to avoid further questions. It did not work. Mr. Arthur called out sharply, "Mr. Jones!" He turned back. "Yes?" "Why stall us? I have been informed authoritatively that the ship is lost." Max tried to look puzzled. "I don't follow you. We seem to be in it." Mr. Arthur snorted. "You know what I mean! Something went wrong with that whatyoumucallit--transition. We're lost." Max put on a school-teacherish manner, ticking off points on his fingers. "Mr. Arthur, I assure you that the ship is in absolutely no danger. As for being lost, I assure you just as firmly that if we are, the Captain neglected to tell me so. I was in the control room at transition and he seemed quite satisfied with it. Would you mind telling me who has been spreading this story? It's a serious thing, starting such rumors. People have been known to panic." "Well . . . it was one of the crew. I don't know his name." Max nodded. "I thought so. Now in my experience in space . . ." He went on, quoting from his uncle. ". . . I have learned that the only thing faster than light is the speed with which a story can spread through a ship. It doesn't have to have any foundation, it spreads just the same." He looked around again. "I wonder what has happened to dinner? I'd hate to go on watch hungry." Mrs. Weberbauer said nervously, "Then we are all right, Maxie?" "We're all right, ma'am." Mrs. Daigler leaned toward him again and whispered, "Then why are you sweating, Max?" He was saved by a steward's mate rushing up to the table and starting to deal out plates of soup. Max stopped him when he came around and said quietly, "Jim, where's Dumont?" Out of the corner of his mouth the waiter said, "Cooking." "Huh? Where's the chef?" The steward's mate leaned down and whispered, "Frenchy is boiled as a judge. I guess he couldn't take it. You know." Max let him go. Mr. Arthur said sharply, "What did he tell you?" "I was trying to find out what went wrong in the galley," Max answered. "Seems the cook incapacitated himself." He spooned up a mouthful of the soup. "From the taste I'd say he had burned his thumb in this so-called chowder. Pretty bad, isn't it?" Max was saved from further evasions by the arrival of the First Officer. Mr. Walther went to the Captain's table and banged on a glass with a spoon. "Your attention, please!" He waited for quiet, then took a paper from his pocket. "I have an announcement to make on behalf of the Captain. Those of you who are familiar with the theory of astrogation are aware that space is changing constantly, due to the motions of the stars, and that consequently no two trips are exactly alike. Sometimes it is necessary, for this reason, to make certain changes in a ship's routing. Such a circumstance has arisen in this present trip and the _Asgard_ will be somewhat delayed in reaching her next destination. We regret this, but we can't change the laws of nature. We hope that you will treat it as a minor inconvenience--or even as additional vacation, in the friendly and comfortable atmosphere of our ship. Please remember, too, that the insurance policy accompanying your ticket covers you completely against loss or damage you may be cost through the ship being behind schedule." He put away the paper; Max had the impression that he had not actually been reading from it. "That is all that the Captain had to say, but I want to add something myself. It has come to my attention that someone has been spreading silly rumors about this minor change in schedule. I am sorry if any of you have been alarmed thereby and I assure you that I will take very strict measures if the originator can be identified." He risked a dignified smile. "But you know how difficult it is to trace down a bit of gossip. In any case, I want to assure you all that the _Asgard_ is in no danger of any sort. The old girl was plying space long before any of us were born, she'll still be going strong after we all die of old age--bless her sturdy bones!" He turned and left at once. Max had listened in open-mouthed admiration. He came from country where the "whopper" was a respected literary art and it seemed to him that he had never heard a lie told with more grace, never seen one interwoven with truth with such skill, in his life. Piece by piece, it was impossible to say that anything the First Officer had said was untrue; taken as a whole it was a flat statement that the _Asgard_ was not lost--a lie if he ever heard one. He turned back toward his table mates. "Will someone pass the butter, please?" Mr. Arthur caught his eye. "And you told us," he said sharply, "that nothing was wrong!" Mr. Daigler growled, "Lay off him, Arthur. Max did pretty well, under the circumstances." Mrs. Weberbauer looked bewildered. "But Mr. Walther said that everything was all right?" Daigler looked at her with compassion. "We're in trouble, Mama Weberbauer. That's obvious. But all we can do is keep calm and trust the ship's officers. Right, Max?" "I guess that's right, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre1">15</p>
<p class="calibre1">"THIS ISN'T A PICNIC"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max kept to his room that evening and the next day, wishing neither to be questioned by passengers nor to answer questions about why he had been relieved of duty. In consequence he missed the riot, having slept through it. He first heard of it when the steward's mate who tended his room showed up with a black eye. "Who gave you the shiner, Garcia?" "I'm not sure, sir. It happened in the ruckus last night." "Ruckus? What ruckus?" "You mean you don't know?" "This is the first I've heard of it. What happened?" Garcia Lopez stared at the overhead. "Well--I wouldn't want to say too much. You know how it is-- nobody wants to testify against a mate. No?" "Who asked you to peach on a mate? You don't have to mention names--but what happened?" "Well, sir. Some of those chicos, they ain't got much sense." Slowly Max learned that the unrest among the crew had been greater than that among the passengers, possibly because they understand more clearly the predicament. Some of them had consulted with Giordano's poor-man's vodka, then had decided to call on the Captain in a body and demand straight talk. The violence had taken place when the master-at-arms had attempted to turn them back at the companionway to "C" deck. "Anybody hurt?" "Not what you'd call hurt. Cut up a little. I picked this up . . ." He touched his eye tenderly. ". . . from being too anxious to see what was going on. Slats Kovak busted an ankle." "Kovak! Why would _he_ be in it?" It did not make sense that a member of the Worry gang should take part in anything so unreasonable. "He was coming down, coming off watch, I guess. Maybe he was backing up the constable. Or maybe he just got caught in the swinging doors. Your friend Sam Anderson was sure in the thick of it." Sam! Max felt sick at heart--Sam in trouble _again!_ "You're sure?" "I was there." "Uh, he wasn't leading it, was he?" "Oh, you got me wrong, M-- Mr. Jones. He settled it. I never see a man who could use his hands like that. He'd grab two of 'em . . . _clop!_ their heads would come together. Then he would grab two more." Max decided to come out of hiding and do two things; look up Kovak, find out how he was and what he might need or want, and second, look up Sam. But before he could leave Smythe arrived with a watch list to initial. He found that he was assigned watch-and-watch with Simes--and that he himself was due on watch immediately. He went up, wondering what had caused Simes to relent. Kelly was in the control room; Max looked around, did not see Simes. "You got it, Chief?" "Until you relieve me. This is my last watch." "How's that? Are you his pet peeve now?" "You could say so. But not the way you think, Max. He drew up a watch list with him and me heel-and-toe. I politely pointed out the guild rules, that I wasn't being paid to take the responsibility of top watch." "Oh, brother! What did he say?" "What could he say? He could order me in writing and I could accept in writing, with my objection to the orders entered in the log--and his neck is out a yard. Which left him his choice of putting you back on the list, asking the Captain to split it with him, or turning his cap around and relieving himself for the next few weeks. With Kovak laid up it didn't leave him much choice. You heard about Kovak?" "Yes. Say, what was that?" Max glanced over where Noguchi was loafing at the computer and lowered his voice. "Mutiny?" Kelly's eyes grew round. "Why, as I understand it, sir, Kovak slipped and fell down a companionway." "Oh. Like that, huh?" "That's what it says in the log." "Hmm . . . well, I guess I had better relieve you. What's the dope?" They were in orbit under power for the nearby G-type star; the orders were entered in the Captain's order book . . . in Simes' handwriting but with Captain Blaine's signature underneath. To Max it looked shaky, as if the Old Man had signed it under emotional stress. Kelly had already placed them in the groove. "Have we given up trying to find out where we are?" Max asked. "Oh, no. Orders are to spend as much time as routine permits on it. But I'll lay you seven to two you don't find anything. Max, this is somewhere else entirely." "Don't give up. How do you know?" "I feel it." Nevertheless Max spent the watch "fishing." But with no luck. Spectrograms, properly taken and measured, are to stars what fingerprints are to men; they can be classified and comparisons made with those on file which are most nearly similar. While he found many which matched fairly closely with catalogued spectra, there was always the difference that makes one identical twin not quite like his brother. Fifteen minutes before the end of the watch he stopped, and made sure that he was ready to be relieved. While waiting he thought about the shenanigan Kelly had pulled to get him back on duty. Good old Kelly! He knew Kelly well enough to know that he must not thank him; to do so would be to attribute to the Chief Computerman a motive which was "improper"--just wink the other eye and remember it. Simes stomped in five minutes past the hour. He said nothing but looked over the log and records of observations Max had made. Max waited several minutes while growing more and more annoyed. At last he said, "Are you ready to relieve me, sir?" "All in good time. I want to see first what you've loused up this time." Max kept his mouth shut. Simes pointed at the log where Max had signed it followed by "C.O. o/W." "That's wrong, to start with. Add 'under instruction.'" Max breathed deeply. "Whose instruction, sir?" "Mine." Max hesitated only momentarily before answering, "No, sir. Not unless you are present during my watch to supervise me." "Are you defying me?" "No, sir. But I'll take written orders on that point . . . entered in the log." Simes closed the log book and looked him slowly up and down. "Mister, if we weren't short-handed you wouldn't be on watch. You aren't ready for a top watch--and it's my opinion that you won't ever be." "If that's the way you feel, sir, I'd just as lief go back to chartsman. Or steward's mate." "That's where you belong!" Simes' voice was almost a scream. Noguchi had hung around after Lundy had relieved him; they both looked up, then turned their heads away. Max made no effort to keep his answer private. "Very good, sir. Will you relieve me? I'll go tell the First Officer that I am surrendering my temporary appointment and reverting to my permanent billet." Max expected a blast. But Simes made a visible effort to control himself and said almost quietly, "See here, Jones, you don't have the right attitude." Max thought to himself, "What have I got to lose?" Aloud he said, "You're the one who doesn't have the right attitude, sir." "Eh? What's that?" "You've been riding me ever since I came to work in the Hole. You've never bothered to give me any instruction and you've found fault with everything I did. Since my probationary appointment it's been four times worse. You came to my room and told me that you were opposed to my appointment, that you didn't want me . . ." "You can't prove that!" "I don't have to. Now you tell me that I'm not fit to stand the watch you've just required me to stand. You've made it plain that you will never recommend me for permanent appointment, so obviously I'm wasting my time. I'll go back to the Purser's gang and do what I can there. Now, will you relieve me, sir?" "You're insubordinate." "No, sir, I am not. I have spoken respectfully, stating facts. I have requested that I be relieved--my watch was over a good half hour ago--in order that I may see the First Officer and revert to my permanent billet. As allowed by the rules of both guilds," Max added. "I won't let you." "It's my option, sir. You have no choice." Simes' face showed that he indeed had no choice. He remained silent for some time, then said more quietly, "Forget it. You're relieved. Be back up here at eight o'clock." "Not so fast, sir. You have stated publicly that I am not competent to take the watch. Therefore I can't accept the responsibility." "Confound it! What are you trying to do? Blackmail me? Max agreed in his mind that such was about it, but he answered, "I wouldn't say so, sir. You can't have it both ways." "Well--I suppose you are competent to stand this sort of watch. There isn't anything to do, actually." "Very good, sir. Will you kindly log the fact?" "Huh?" "In view of the circumstances, sir, I insist on the letter of the rules and ask you to log it." Simes swore under his breath, then grabbed the stylus and wrote quickly. He swung the log book around. There!" Max read: "M. Jones is considered qualified to stand a top watch in space, not involving anomaly. (s) R. Simes, Astrogator." Max noted the reservation, the exception that would allow Simes to keep him from ever reaching permanent status. But Simes had stayed within the law. Besides, he admitted to himself, he didn't want to leave the Worry gang. He comforted himself with the thought that since they were all lost together it might never matter what Simes recommended. "Quite satisfactory, sir." Simes grabbed the book. "Now get out. See that you're back here on time." "Aye aye, sir." Max could not refrain from having the last word, standing up to Simes had gone to his head. "Which reminds me, sir: will you please relieve me on time after this?" "_What?_" "Under the law a man can't be worked more than four hours out of eight, except for a logged emergency." "Go below!" Max went below, feeling both exultant and sick. He had no taste for fights, never had; they left him with a twisted lump inside. He burst into his room, and almost fell over Sam. "Sam!" "The same. What's eating you, boy? You look like the goblins had been chasing you." Max flopped on his bunk and sighed. "I feel that way, too." He told Sam about the row with Simes. Sam nodded approval. "That's the way to deal with a jerk like that--insult him until he apologizes. Give him lumps enough times and he'll eat out of your hand." Max shook his head dolefully. "Today was fun, but he'll find some way to take it out on me. Oh, well!" "Not so, my lad. Keep your nose clean and wait for the breaks. If a man is stupid and bad-tempered-- which he is, I sized him up long ago--if you are smart and keep _your_ temper, eventually he leaves himself wide open. That's a law of nature." "Maybe." Max swung around and sat up. "Sam-- you're wearing your shield again." Sam stuck his thumb under the badge of office of Chief Master-at-Arms. "Didn't you notice?" "I guess I was spinning too fast. Tell me about it-- did the First decide to forgive and forget?" "Not precisely. You know about that little excitement last night?" "Well, yes. But I understand that officially nothing happened?" "Correct. Mr. Walther knows when to pull his punches." "What did happen? I heard you cracked some skulls together." "Nothing much. And not very hard. I've seen ships where it would have been regarded as healthy exercise to settle your dinner. Some of the lads got scared and that made them lap up happy water. Then a couple with big mouths and no forehead got the inspiration that it was their right to talk to the Captain about it. Being sheep, they had to go in a flock. If they had run into an officer, he could have sent them back to bed with no trouble. But my unfortunate predecessor happened to run into them and told them to disperse. Which they didn't. He's not the diplomatic type, I'm afraid. So he hollered, 'Hey, Rube!' in his quaint idiom and the fun began." "But where do you figure? You came to help him?" "Hardly. I was standing at a safe distance, enjoying the festivities, when I noticed Mr. Walther's bedroom slippers coming down the ladder. Whereupon I waded in and was prominent in the ending. The way to win a medal, Max, is to make sure the general is watching, then act." Max grinned. "Somehow I hadn't figured you for the hero type." "Heaven forbid! But it worked out. Mr. Walther sent for me, ate me out, told me that I was a scoundrel and a thief and a nogoodnick--then offered me my shield back if I could keep order below decks. I looked him in the eye, a sincere type look, and told him I would do my best. So here I am." "I'm mighty pleased, Sam." "Thanks. Then he looked me in the eye and told me that he had reason to suspect--as if he didn't know!-- that there might be a still somewhere in the ship. He ordered me to find it, and then destroy any liquor I found." "So? How did Mr. Gee take that?" "Why, Fats and I disassembled his still and took the pieces back to stores, then we locked up his stock in trade. I pleaded with him not to touch it until the ship was out of its mess. I explained that I would break both his arms if he did." Max chuckled. "Well, I'm glad you're back in good graces. And it was nice of you to come tell me about it." He yawned. "Sorry. I'm dead for sleep." "I'll vamoose. But I didn't come to tell you, I came to ask a question." "Huh? What?" "Have you seen the Skipper lately?" Max thought back. "Not since transition. Why?" "Nor has anyone else. I thought he might be spending his time in the Worry Hole." "No. Come to think, he hasn't been at his table either--at least when I've been in the lounge." "He's been eating in his cabin." Sam stood up. "Very, very interesting. Mmm . . . I wouldn't talk about it, Max." Simes was monosyllabic when Max relieved him. Thereafter they had no more words; Simes acted as if Max did not exist except for the brief formalities in relieving. The Captain did not show up in the control room. Several times Max was on the point of asking Kelly about it, but each time decided not to. But there were rumors around the ship--the Captain was sick, the Captain was in a coma, Walther and the Surgeon had relieved him of duty, the Captain was constantly at his desk, working out a new and remarkable way to get the ship back to where it belonged. By now it was accepted that the ship was lost, but the time for hysteria had passed; passengers and crew were calm and there seemed to be general consent that the decision to put down around the solar-type star toward which they were headed was the only reasonable decision. They were close enough now that it had been determined that the star did have planets-- no G-class star had ever been found to be without planets, but to pick them up on a stereoplate was consoling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It came to a choice between planet #3 and planet #4. Bolometric readings showed the star to have a surface temperature slightly over 6000� Kelvin, consistent with its spectrum; it was not much larger than Father Sol; calculated surface temperatures for the third and fourth planets gave a probability that the third might be uncomfortably hot whereas number four might be frigid. Both had atmospheres. A fast hyperboloid swing past both settled the matter. The bolometer showed number three to be too hot and even number four to be tropical. Number four had a moon which the third did not--another advantage for four, for it permitted, by examining the satellite's period, an easy calculation of its mass; from that and its visible diameter its surface gravity was a matter of substitution in classic Newtonian formula . . . ninety-three percent of Earth-normal, comfortable and rather low in view of its over ten-thousand-mile diameter. Absorption spectra showed oxygen and several inert gases. Simes assisted by Kelly placed the _Asgard_ in a pole-to-pole orbit to permit easy examination--Max, as usual, was left to chew his nails. The Captain did not come to the control room even to watch this maneuver. They hung in parking orbit while their possible future home was examined from the control room and stared at endlessly from the lounge. It was in the lounge that Ellie tracked Max down. He had hardly seen her during the approach, being too busy and too tired with a continuous heel-and-toe watch and in the second place with much on his mind that he did not want to have wormed out of him. But, once the orbit was established and power was off, under standard doctrine Simes could permit the watch to be taken by crewmen--which he did and again told Max to stay out of the control room. Max could not resist the fascination of staring at the strange planet; he crowded into the lounge along with the rest. He was standing back and gazing over heads when he felt his arm grabbed. "Where have you been?" "Working." He reached out and caressed Chipsie; the spider puppy leaped to his shoulders and started searching him. "Hmmmph! You don't work all the time. Do you know that I sent _nine_ notes to your room this past week?" Max knew. He had saved them but had not answered. "Sorry." "Sorry he says. Never mind-- Max, tell me all about it." She turned and looked out. "What have they named it? Is there anybody on it? Where are we going to land? _When_ are we going to land? Max, aren't you _excited?_" "Whew! They haven't named it yet--we just call it 'the planet' or 'number four.' Kelly wants to name it 'Hendrix.' Simes is hedging; I think he wants to name it after himself. The Captain hasn't made any decision that I know of." "They ought to name it 'Truth' or 'Hope' or something like that. Where is the Captain, Max? I haven't seen the old dear for _days_." "He's working. This is a busy time for him, of course." Max reflected that his evasion might be true. "About your other questions, we haven't seen any signs of cities or towns or anything that looks like civilization." "What do you mean by 'civilization'? Not a lot of dirty old cities surely?" Max scratched his head and grinned. "You've got me. But I don't see how you could have it, whatever it is, without cities." "Why not? Bees have cities, ants have cities, challawabs have cities. None of them is civilized. I can think of a lovely civilization that would just sit around in trees and sing and think beautiful thoughts." "Is that what you want?" "No, it would bore me to death. But I can think about it, can't I? You didn't say when we were going to land?" "I don't know. When they decide it's safe." "I wish they would hurry. Isn't it thrilling? Just like Robinson Crusoe, or Swiss Family Robinson--I can't keep those two straight. Or the first men on Venus." "They died." "So they did. But we won't, not on--" She waved her hand at the lovely green and blue and cloudy-white globe. "--not on, uh, I'm going to call it 'Charity' because that's what it looks like." Max said soberly, "Ellie, don't you realize this is serious?" He kept his voice low in order not to alarm others. "This isn't a picnic. If this place doesn't work out, it might be pretty awful." "Why?" "Look, don't quote me and don't talk about it. But I don't think any of us will ever get home again." She sobered momentarily, then shrugged and smiled. "You can't frighten me. Sure, I'd like to go home--but if I can't, well, Charity is going to be good to us. I know it." Max shut up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">16</p>
<p class="calibre1">"--OVER A HUNDRED YEARS--"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The _Asgard_ landed on Charity the following day. Eldreth affixed her choice by the statistical process of referring to the planet by that name, assuming that it was official, and repeating it frequently. When word was passed that landing would commence at noon, ship's time, Max went to the control room and simply assumed that it was his right to be present. Simes looked at him sourly but said nothing-- for an evident reason: Captain Blaine was present. Max was shocked at his appearance. The Captain seemed to have aged ten to fifteen years since the bad transition. In place of his habitual cheerful expression was one that Max had trouble tagging--until he recalled that he had seen it on horses, on horses too old to work but still working--head bent, eyes dull, mute and resigned against a fate both inescapable and unbearable. The old man's skin hung loose, as if he had not eaten for days or weeks. He seemed hardly interested in what was going on around him. He spoke only once during the maneuver. Just before the chronometer showed noon Simes straightened up from the console and looked at his skipper. Blaine lifted his head and said in a hoarse whisper, "Take her down, Mister." An Imperial military ship in landing on a strange spot would normally guide a radar-beacon robot down first, then home in on the beacon. But the _Asgard_ was a merchant liner; she expected to land nowhere but at ports equipped with beams and beacons and other aids. Consequently the landing was made blind by precomputed radar-automatic and was planned for an open valley selected by photograph. The planet was densely wooded in most areas, choice was limited. Simes presented a picture of the alert pilot, hands poised at the controls, eyes on the radar screen portraying the view below them, while racked in front of him were comparison photographs, radar and visual. The let down was without incident; starry black sky gave way to deep purple, then to blue. There was not even a jar as the ship touched, for its private gravity inside its Horstian field kept them from feeling impressed acceleration. Max knew they were down when he saw Simes cut in the thrust beams to cradle the ship upright. Simes said to the microphone, "Power room, start auxiliaries and secure. All hands, dirtside routine, first section." He turned to Blaine. "Grounded, Captain." Blaine's lips shaped the words, "Very good, sir." He got up and shuffled toward the hatch. When he had gone Simes ordered, "Lundy, take stand-by watch. The rest of you clear the control room." Max went down with Kelly. When they reached "A" deck Max said grudgingly, "It was a smart landing I'll have to admit." "Thanks," said Kelly. Max glanced at him. "So you calculated it?" "I didn't say that. I just said, 'Thanks.'" "So? Well, you're welcome." Max felt his weight pulse and suddenly he was a trifle lighter. "They cut the field. Now we're really down." He was about to invite Kelly into his room for the inevitable coffee when the ship's speakers sounded: "All hands! All passengers! Report to Bifrost Lounge for an important announcement. Those on watch are ordered to listen in by phone." "What's up?" asked Max. "Why wonder? We'll go see." The lounge was crowded with passengers and crew. First Officer Walther stood near the Captain's table, counting the crowd with his eyes. Max saw him speak to Bennett, who nodded and hurried away. The large view port was across the lounge from Max; he stretched on his toes and tried to see out. All he could see was hilltops and blue sky. There was a lessening of the murmur of voices; Max looked around to see Bennett preceding Captain Blaine through the crowd. The Captain went to his table and sat down; the First Officer glanced at him, then cleared his throat loudly. "Quiet, please." He went on, "I've called you together because Captain Blaine has something he wants to say to you." He stopped and stepped back respectfully. Captain Blaine slowly stood up, looked uncertainly around. Max saw him square his thin shoulders and lift his head. "Men," he said, his voice suddenly firm and strong. "My guests and friends--" he went on, his voice sinking. There was a hush in the lounge, Max could hear the Captain's labored breathing. He again asserted control of himself and continued, "I have brought you . . . I have brought you as far as I can. . ." His voice trailed off. He looked at them for a long moment, his mouth trembling. It seemed impossible for him to continue. The crowd started to stir. But he did continue and they immediately quieted. "I have something else to say," he began, then paused. This pause was longer, when he broke it his voice was a whisper. "I'm sorry. God keep you all." He turned and started for the door. Bennett slipped quickly in front of him. Max could hear him saying quietly and firmly: "Gangway, please. Way for the Captain." No one said anything until he was gone, but a woman passenger at Max's elbow was sobbing softly. Mr. Walther's sharp, clear voice rang out. "Don't go away, anyone! I have additional announcements to make." His manner ignored what they had all just seen. "The time has come to sum up our present situation. As you can see, this planet is much like our Mother Earth. Tests must be made to be sure that the atmosphere is breathable, and so forth; the Surgeon and the Chief Engineer are making them now. But it seems likely that this new planet will prove to be eminently suitable for human beings, probably even more friendly than Earth. "So far, we have seen no indications of civilized life. On the whole, that seems a good thing. Now as to our resources-- The _Asgard_ carries a variety of domestic animals, they will be useful and should be conserved as breeding stock. We have an even wider variety of useful plants, both in the ship's hydroponic gardens and carried as seeds. We have a limited but adequate supply of tools. Most important of all the ship's library contains a fair cross-section of our culture. Equally important, we ourselves have our skills and traditions . . ." "Mr. Walther!" "Yes, Mr. Hornsby?" "Are you trying to tell us that you are dumping us here?" Walther looked at him coldly. "No. Nobody is being 'dumped' as you put it. You can stay in the ship and you will be treated as a guest as long as the _Asgard_-- or you yourself--is alive. Or until the ship reaches the destination on your ticket. If it does. No, I have been trying to discuss reasonably an open secret; this ship is lost." A voiceless sigh went through the room. All of them knew it, but up till now it had not been admitted officially. The flat announcement from a responsible officer echoed like the sentence of a court. "Let me state the legal position," Mr. Walther went on. "While this ship was in space you passengers were subject to the authority of the Captain, as defined by law, and through him you were subject to me and the other ship's officers. Now we have landed. You may go freely . . . or you may stay. Legally this is an unscheduled stopover; if the ship ever leaves here you may return to it and continue as passengers. That is my responsibility to you and it will be carried out. But I tell you plainly that at present I have no hope to offer that we will ever leave here--which is why I spoke of colonizing. We are lost." In the rear of the room a woman began to scream hysterically, with incoherent sounds of, ". . . home! I want to go home! Take me . . ." Walther's voice cut through the hubbub. "Dumont! Flannigan! Remove her. Take her to the Surgeon." He continued as if nothing had happened. "The ship and the ship's crew will give every assistance possible, consistent with my legal responsibility to keep the ship in commission, to aid any of you who wish to colonize. Personally I think . . ." A surly voice cut in, "Why talk about 'law'? There is no law here!" Walther did not even raise his voice. "But there is. As long as this ship is in commission, there is law, no matter how many light-years she may be from her home port. Furthermore, while I have no authority over any who choose to leave the ship, I strongly advise you to make it your first act dirtside to hold a town meeting, elect officers, and found a constitutional government. I doubt that you can survive otherwise." "Mr. Walther." "Yes, Mr. Daigler?" "This is obviously no time for recriminations . . ." "Obviously!" Daigler grinned wryly. "So I won't indulge, though I could think of some. But it happens that I know something professionally about the economics of colonizing." "Good! We'll use your knowledge." "Will you let me finish? A prime principle in maintaining a colony out of touch with its supply base is to make it large enough. It's a statistical matter, too small a colony can be overwhelmed by a minor setback. It's like going into a dice game with too little money: three bad rolls and you're sunk. Looking around me, it's evident that we have much less than optimal minimum. In fact--" "It's what we have, Mr. Daigler." "I see that. I'm not a wishful thinker. What I want to know is, can we count on the crew as well?" Mr. Walther shook his head. "This ship will not be decommissioned as long as there are men capable of manning it. There is always hope, no matter how small, that we may find a way home. It is even possible that an Imperial survey ship might discover us. I'm sorry--no." "That isn't quite what I asked. I was two jumps ahead of you, I figured you wouldn't let the crew colonize. But can we count on their help? We seem to have about six females, give or take one, who will probably help to carry on the race. That means that the next generation of our new nation is going to be much smaller. Such a colony would flicker and die, by statistical probability--unless every man jack of us works ten hours a day for the rest of his life, just to give our children a better chance of making it. That's all right with me, if we all make an all-out try. But it will take all the manpower we have to make sure that some young people who aren't even born yet get by thirty years from now. Will the crew help?" Mr. Walther said quietly, "I think you can count on it." "Good enough." A small, red-faced man whose name Max had never learned interrupted. "Good enough, my eye! I'm going to sue the company, I'm going to sue the ship's officers individually. I'm going to shout it from the . . ." Max saw Sam slipping through the crowd to the man's side, the disturbance stopped abruptly. "Take him to the Surgeon," Mr. Walther said wearily. "He can sue us tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned." Max started for his room. Eldreth caught up with him. "Max! I want to talk with you." "All right." He started back toward the lounge. "No, I want to talk privately. Let's go to your room." "Huh? Mrs. Dumont would blow her top, then she'd tell Mr. Walther." "Bother with all that! Those silly rules are dead. Didn't you listen at the meeting?" "You're the one who didn't listen." He took her firmly by the arm, turned her toward the public room. They ran into Mr. and Mrs. Daigler coming the other way. Daigler said, "Max? Are you busy?" "Yes," answered Eldreth. "No," said Max. "Hmm . . . you two had better take a vote. I'd like to ask Max some questions. I've no objection to your being with us, Eldreth, if you will forgive the intrusion. She shrugged. "Oh, well, maybe you can handle him. I can't." They went to the Daiglers' stateroom, larger and more luxurious than Max's and possessing two chairs. The two women perched on the bed, the men took the chairs. Daigler began, "Max, you impress me as a man who prefers to give a straight answer. There are things I want to know that I didn't care to ask out there. Maybe you can tell me." "I will if I can." "Good. I've tried to ask Mr. Simes, all I get is a snottily polite brush off. I haven't been able to get in to see the Captain--after today I see that there wouldn't have been any point anyhow. Now, can you tell me, with the mathematics left out, what chance we have to get home? Is it one in three, or one in a thousand--or what?" "Uh, I couldn't answer it that way." "Answer it your own way." "Well, put it this way. While we don't know where we are, we know positively where we aren't. We aren't within, oh, say a hundred light-years of any explored part of the Galaxy." "How do you know? It seems to me that's a pretty big space to be explored in the weeks since we got off the track." "It sure is. It's a globe twelve hundred trillion miles thick. But we didn't have to explore it, not exactly." "Then how?" "Well, sir, we examined the spectra of all first magnitude stars in sight--and a lot more. None of them is in our catalogues. Some are giants that would be first magnitude anywhere within a hundred light-years of them--they'd be certain to be in the catalogues if a survey ship had ever been that close to them. So we are absolutely certain that we are a long, long way from anywhere that men have ever been before. Matter of fact, I spoke too conservatively. Make it a globe twice as thick, eight times as big, and you'd still be way over on the conservative side. We're _really_ lost." "Mmm . . . I'm glad I didn't ask those questions in the lounge. Is there any possibility that we will ever know where we are?" "Oh, sure! There are thousands of stars left to examine. Chief Kelly is probably shooting one this minute." "Well, then, what are the chances that we will eventually find ourselves?" "Oh, I'd say they were excellent--in a year or two at the outside. If not from single stars, then from globular star clusters. You realize that the Galaxy is a hundred thousand light-years across, more or less, and we can see only stars that are fairly close. But the globular clusters make good landmarks, too." Max added the mental reservation, _if we aren't in the wrong galaxy_. There seemed no point in burdening them with that dismaying possibility. Daigler relaxed and took out a cigar. "This is the last of my own brand, but I'll risk smoking it now. Well, Maggie, I guess you won't have to learn how to make soap out of wood ashes and hog drippings after all. Whether it's one year or five, we can sweat it out and go home." "I'm glad." She patted her ornate coiffure with soft, beautifully manicured hands. "I'm hardly the type for it." "But you don't understand!" "Eh? What's that, Max?" "I didn't say we could get back. I just said I thought it was fairly certain we would find out where we are." "What's the difference? We find out, then we go home." "No, because we _can't_ be less than a hundred light-years from explored space." "I don't see the hitch. This ship can do a hundred light-years in a split second. What was the longest leap we made this cruise? Nearly five hundred light-years, wasn't it?" "Yes, but--" Max turned to Eldreth. "You understand? Don't you?" "Well, maybe. That folded-scarf thing you showed me?" "Yes, yes. Mr. Daigler, sure the _Asgard_ can transit five hundred light-years in no time--or any other distance. But _only_ at calculated and surveyed congruencies. We don't know of any within a hundred light-years, at least . . . and we won't know of any even if we find out where we are because we know where we _aren't_. Follow me? That means that the ship would have to travel at top speed for something over a hundred years and maybe much longer, just for the first leg of the trip." Mr. Daigler stared thoughtfully at his cigar ash, then took out a pen knife and cut off the burning end. "I'll save the rest. Well, Maggie, better study up on that homemake soap deal. Thanks, Max. My father was a farmer, I can learn." Max said impulsively, "I'll help you, sir." "Oh yes, you did tell us that you used to be a farmer, didn't you? You should make out all right." His eyes swung to Eldreth. "You know what I would do, if I were you kids? I'd get the Captain to marry you right away. Then you'd be all set to tackle colonial life right." Max blushed to his collar and did not look at Ellie. "I'm afraid I can't. I'm a crew member, I'm not eligible to colonize." Mr. Daigler looked at him curiously. "Such devotion to duty. Well, no doubt Ellie can take her pick among the single men passengers." Eldreth smoothed her skirt demurely. "No doubt." "Come, Maggie. Coming, Eldreth?"</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHARITY</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Charityville" was a going concern within a week. It had a mayor, Mr. Daigler, a main street, Hendrix Avenue, even its first wedding, performed by the mayor in the presence of the villagers--Mr. Arthur and little Becky Weberbauer. The first cottage, now building, was reserved for the newlyweds. It was a log cabin and a very sloppy job, for, while there were those among them who had seen pictures or had even seen log cabins, there was no one who had ever built one before. There was an air of hope, of common courage, even of gaiety in the new community. The place was fragrant with new starts, forward-looking thoughts. They still slept in the ship and breakfasted there, then carried their lunches and labored mightily, men and women alike, through the short day--Charity spun on her axis in twenty-one-plus hours. They returned at nightfall, dined in the ship, and some found energy to dance a bit before going to bed. Charity seemed to be all that her name implied. The days were balmy, the nights were mild--and beautiful beyond anything yet found in the Galaxy. Its star (they simply called it "the Sun") was accompanied by more comets than had yet been seen around any star. A giant with a wide tail stretched from zenith to western horizon, diving at their Sun. Another, not yet so grand but awesome enough to have caused watchers for the end of the world on Earthly hilltops, approached from the north, and two more decorated the southern sky with lace of icy fire. Concomitant with comets was, necessarily, an equal abundance of meteors. Every night was a shower of falling stars, every day ended like Solar Union Day with a display of fireworks. They had seen no dangerous animals. Some of the settlers reported seeing centaurlike creatures about the size of Shetland ponies, but they seemed timid and had scurried away when discovered. The prevalent life form appeared to be marsupial mammals in various sizes and shapes. There were no birds, but there was another sort of flying life not found elsewhere-- jellyfishlike creatures four or five feet high with dangling tendrils, animated balloons. They appeared to have muscular control over their swollen bladders for they could rise and fall, and could even, by some not evident means, go upwind against a gentle breeze--in higher winds they anchored to treetops, or floated free and let the wind carry them. They seemed curious about Charityville and would hang over a work site, turning slowly around as if to see everything. But they never got within reach. Some of the settlers wanted to shoot one down and examine it; Mayor Daigler forbade it. There was another animal too--or might be. They were called "peekers" because all that anyone had seen was something that ducked quickly behind a rock or tree when anyone tried to look. Between the possibly mythical peeker and the ubiquitous balloons the colonists felt that their new neighbors took a deep but not unfriendly interest in what they were doing. Maggie Daigler--she was "Maggie" to everyone now--had put away her jewels, drawn dungarees from ship's stores, and chopped off her hair. Her nails were short and usually black with grime. But she looked years younger and quite happy. In fact, everyone seemed happy but Max. Ellie was avoiding him. He cursed himself and his big mouth thrice daily and four times at night. Sure, Daigler had spoken out of turn--but was that any reason for him to open his mouth and put his foot in it? Of course, he had never figured on marrying Ellie-- but shucks, maybe they were stuck here forever. "Probably," not "maybe," he corrected. The ban on joining the colony would be let up in time--in which case, what was the sense in getting in bad with the only eligible girl around? An astrogator ought to be a bachelor but a farmer needed a wife. Mighty nice to have some one cooking the turnip greens and jointing a chicken while a man was out in the fields. He ought to know--Maw had let it slide often enough. Ellie wouldn't be like Maw. She was strong and practical and with just a little teaching would do all right. Besides she was about the prettiest thing he ever saw, if you looked at her right. When Mr. and Mrs. Dumont, by special dispensation, joined the colony it caused him to act. Since the steward and stewardess would have no duties in a ship without passengers no one could reasonably object--but it gave Max an approach. He went to see the First Officer. "Probationary Apprentice Jones, sir." Walther glanced up. "I think I'd say 'Assistant Astrogator Jones' if I were you. Closer to the facts. Come in." "Uh, that's what I wanted to speak with you about, sir." "So? How?" "I want to revert to my billet." "Eh? Why would you rather be a chartsman than an astrogator? And what difference does it make--now?" "No, sir. I'm electing to resume my permanent appointment, steward's mate third." Walther looked amazed. "There must be more to this. Explain yourself." With much stammering Max explained his trouble with Simes. He tried to be fair and finished with the dismal feeling that he had sounded childish. Walther said, "You're sure about this? Mr. Simes has said nothing to me about you." "He wouldn't, sir. But it's true. You can ask Kelly." Walther thought for a while. "Mr. Jones, I wouldn't attach too much importance to this. At your age these conflicts of personality often seem more serious than they are. My advice is to forget it and do your work. I'll speak to Mr. Simes about his keeping you out of the control room. That isn't proper and I am surprised to hear it." "No, sir." "'No, sir' what?" "I want to return to steward's mate." "Eh? I don't understand you." "Because, sir, I want to join the colony. Like Chief Steward Dumont." "Oh . . . A light begins to dawn." Walther slapped the desk emphatically. "Absolutely no! Under no circumstances." "Sir?" "Please understand me. This is not discrimination. If you were a steward's mate and nothing else, I would consider your request--under the special circumstances which I believe pertain. But you are an astrogator. You know our situation. Dr. Hendrix is dead. Captain Blaine--well, you have seen him. He may recover, I cannot plan on it. Mr. Jones, as long as there is any faint hope that this ship will ever lift again, as long as we have crew to work her, no astrogator, no chartsman, no computerman will be relieved from duty for any reason whatsoever. You see that, don't you?" "I guess so, sir. Uh, aye aye, sir." "Good. By the way, keep this to yourself, but as soon as the colony can get along without us temporarily, I want the ship placed in a parking orbit so that you specialists can maintain a search. You can't work very well through this atmosphere, can you?" "No, sir. Our instruments were designed for open space." "So we must see that you get it." The First Officer sat silent, then added, "Mr. Jones--Max, isn't it? May I speak to you man to man?" "Uh? Certainly, sir." "Mmm . . . Max, this is none of my business, but treat it as fatherly advice. If you have an opportunity to marry--and want to--you don't have to join the colony to do it. If we stay, it won't matter in the long run whether you are crew or a charter member of the village. If we leave, your wife goes with you." Max's ears burned. He could think of nothing to say. "Hypothetical question, of course. But that's the proper solution." Walther stood up. "Why don't you take the day off? Go take a walk or something. Fresh air will do you good. I'll speak to Mr. Simes." Instead, Max went looking for Sam, did not find him in the ship, discovered that he had gone dirtside. He followed him down and walked the half mile to Charityville. Before he reached the building that was being worked on he saw a figure separate itself from the gang. He soon saw that it was Eldreth. She stopped in front of him, a sturdy little figure in dirty dungarees. She planted her feet and set fists on her hips. "Uh, howdy, Ellie." "Up to your old tricks! Avoiding me. Explain yourself." The injustice of it left him stuttering. "But . . . Now see here, Ellie, it's not that way at all. You've been . . ." "A likely story. You sound like Chipsie caught with her hand in a candy dish. I just wanted to tell you, you reluctant Don Juan, that you have nothing to worry about. I'm not marrying anyone this season. So you can resume the uneven tenor of your ways." "But, Ellie . . ." he started desperately. "Want me to put it in writing? Put up a bond?" She looked fiercely at him, then began to laugh, wrinkling her nose. "Oh, Max, you large lout, you arouse the eternal maternal in me. When you are upset your face gets as long as a mule's. Look, forget it." "But, Ellie . . . Well, all right." "Pals?" "Pals." She sighed. "I feel better. I don't know why, but I don't like to be on the outs with you. Where were you going?" "Uh, nowhere. Taking a walk." "Fine. I'll go too. Half a sec while I gather in Chipsie." She turned and called, "Mister Chips! Chipsie!" "I don't see her." "I'll get her." She ran off, to return quickly with the spider puppy on her shoulder and a package in her hand. "I picked up my lunch. We can split it." "Oh, we won't be gone that long. Hi, Chipsie baby." "Hi, Max. Candy?" He dug into a pocket, found a sugar cube that he had saved several days ago for the purpose; the spider puppy accepted it gravely and said, "Thank you." "Yes, we will," Ellie disagreed, "because some of the men saw a herd of those centaur ponies the other side of that ridge. It's quite a hike." "I don't think we ought to go that far," he said doubtfully. "Won't they miss you?" "I've been doing my share. See my callouses?" She stuck out a grimy paw. "I told Mr. Hornsby that I was suddenly come down with never-get-overs and he would have to find somebody else to hold while he hammered." He was pleased to give in. They went up rising ground and into an arroyo and soon were in a grove of primitive conifers. Mr. Chips jumped down from Ellie's shoulders and scurried up a tree. Max stopped. "Hadn't we better catch her?" "You worry too much. Chipsie wouldn't run away. She'd be scared to death. Chipsie! Here, honey!" The spider puppy hustled through branches, got directly above them, dropped a cone on Max. Then she laughed, a high giggle. "See? She just wants to play." The ridge was high and Max found that his hillbilly's wind had been lost somewhere among the stars. The arroyo meandered slowly upwards. He was still woodsman enough to keep a sharp eye out for landmarks and directions. At weary last they topped the crest. Ellie paused. "I guess they're gone," she said disappointedly, staring out over flatter country below them. "No! Look over there. See them! About two dozen little black dots." "Uh huh. Yeah." "Let's go closer. I want a good look." "I wonder if that's smart? We're a far piece from the ship and I'm not armed." "Oh, they're harmless." "I was thinking of what else might be in these woods." "But we're already in the woods, and all we've seen are the hobgoblins." She referred to the balloonlike creatures, two of which had trailed them up the arroyo. The humans had grown so used to their presence that they no longer paid them any attention. "Ellie, it's time we went back." "No." "Yes. I'm responsible for you. You've seen your centaurs." "Max Jones, I'm a free citizen. You may be starting back; I'm going to have a close look at those underslung cow ponies." She started down. "Well-- Wait a moment. I want to get my bearings." He took a full look around, fixed the scene forever in his mind, and followed her. He was not anxious to thwart her anyhow; he had been mulling over the notion that this was a good time to explain why he had said what he had said to Mr. Daigler--and perhaps lead around to the general subject of the future. He wouldn't go so far as to talk about marriage-- though he might bring it up in the abstract if he could figure out an approach. How did you approach such a subject? You didn't just say, "There go the hobgoblins, let's you and me get married!" Ellie paused. "There go the hobgloblins. Looks as if they were heading right for the herd." Max frowned. "Could be. Maybe they talk to them?" She laughed. "Those things?" She looked him over carefully. "Maxie, I've just figured out why I bother with you." Huh? Maybe she was going to lead up to it for him. "Why?" "Because you remind me of Putzie. You get the same puzzled look he does." "'Putzie?' Who is Putzie?" "Putzie is the man my father shipped me off to Earth to get me away from--and the reason I crushed out of three schools to get back to Hespera. Only Daddy will probably have shipped him off, too. Daddy is tricky. Come here, Chipsie. Don't go so far." She continued, "You'll love Putzie. He's nice. Stop it, Chipsie." Max despised the man already. "I don't like to fret you," he said, "but it's a long way to Hespera." "I know. Let's not borrow trouble." She looked him over again. "I might keep you in reserve, if you weren't so jumpy." Before he could think of the right answer she had started down. The centaurs--it seemed the best name, though the underparts were not much like horses and the parts that stuck up were only vaguely humanoid--clustered near the foot of the hill, not far out from the trees. They weren't grazing, it was hard to tell what they were doing. The two hobgoblins were over the group, hovering as if in interest just as they did with humans. Ellie insisted on going to the edge of the clearing to see them better. They reminded Max of clowns made up to look like horses. They had silly, simple expressions and apparently no room for a brain case. They appeared to be marsupials, with pouches almost like bibs. Either they were all females or with this species the male had a pouch too. Several little centaurs were cavorting around, in and out the legs of their elders. One of the babies spied them, came trotting toward them, sniffling and bleating. Behind it the largest adult pulled out of the herd to watch the young one. The colt scampered up and stopped about twenty feet away. "Oh, the darling!" Ellie said and ran out a few feet, dropped to one knee. "Come here, pet. Come to mama." Max started for her. "Ellie! Come back here!" The large centaur reached into its pouch, hauled out something, swung it around its head like a gaucho's throwing rope. "Ellie!" He reached her just as it let go. The thing struck them, wound around and held them. Ellie screamed and Max struggled to tear it loose--but they were held like Laoco� Another line came flying through the air, clung to them. And another. Mr. Chips had followed Ellie. Now she skittered away, crying. She stopped at the edge of the clearing and shrilled, "Max! Ellie! Come _back_. _Please_ back!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">18</p>
<p class="calibre1">CIVILIZATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ellie did not faint nor grow hysterical. After that involuntary scream, her next remark was simply, "Max, I'm sorry. My fault." The words were almost in his ear, so tightly were they tied together by the clinging ropes. He answered, "I'll get us loose!" and continued to strain at their bonds. "Don't struggle," she said quietly, "It just makes them tighter. We'll have to talk our way out of this." What she said was true; the harder he strained the tighter the pythonlike bonds held them. "Don't," Ellie pleaded. "You're making it worse. It's hurting me." Max desisted. The largest centaur ambled up and looked them over. Its broad simple face was still more ludicrous close up and its large brown eyes held a look of gentle astonishment. The colt approached from the other side and sniffed curiously, bleated in a high voice. The adult bugled like an elk; the colt shied sideways, then rejoined the herd on a dead run. "Take it easy," Ellie whispered. "I think they were scared that we would hurt the baby. Maybe they'll just look us over and let us go." "Maybe. But I wish I could get at my knife." "I'm glad you can't. This calls for diplomacy." The rest of the herd came up, milled around and looked them over, while exchanging calls that combined bugling, whinnying, and something between a cough and a snort. Max listened. "That's language," he decided. "Of course. And how I wish I had studied it at Miss Mimsey's." The largest centaur leaned over them, smoothed at their bonds; they became looser but still held them. Max said sharply, "I think they are going to untie us. Get ready to run." "Yes, boss." Another centaur reached into its built-in pouch, took out another of the ropelike things. It dropped to its fore knees, flipped the end so that it curled around Max's left ankle. The end seemed to weld into a loop, hobbling Max as effectively as a bowline knot; Ellie was treated the same way. The biggest centaur then patted their bonds, which fell off and writhed gently on the ground. It picked them up and stuffed them into its pouch. The centaur which had hobbled them wrapped the ends of their tethers around its upright trunk, they merged into a belt. After an exchange of sour bugle calls with the leader, it patted the leashes, . . . which then stretched like taffy, becoming quite twenty feet long and much more slender. Max pressed his knife on Ellie and said, "Try to cut yourself loose. If you can, then run for it. I'll keep them busy." "No, Max." "Yes! Dawggone it, quit being a brat! You've made enough trouble." "Yes, Max." She took the knife and tried to saw through the strange rope near her ankle. The centaurs made no attempt to stop her, but watched with the same air of gentle astonishment. It was as if they had never seen a knife, had no notion of what one was. Presently she gave up. "No good, Max. It's like trying to slice duraplastic." "Why, I keep that knife like a razor. Let me try." He had no better luck. He was forced to stop by the herd moving out--walk or be dragged. He managed to close the knife while hopping on one foot to save his balance. The group proceeded at a slow walk for a few steps, then the leader bugled and the centaurs broke into a trot, exactly like ancient cavalry. Ellie stumbled at once and was dragged. Max sat down, managed to grab his hobble and hang on while shouting, "Hey! Stop!" Their captor stopped and looked around almost apologetically. Max said, "Look, stupid. We can't keep up. We're not horses," while helping Ellie to her feet. "Are you hurt, kid?" "I guess not." She blinked back tears. "If I could lay hands on that hay-burning oaf, he'd be hurt--plenty!" "You skinned your hand." "It won't kill me. Just tell him to slow down, will you?" Seeing them on their feet the monster immediately started to trot again. Down they went again, with Max trying to drag them to a halt. This time the leader trotted back from the main herd and consulted their custodian. Max took part, making up in vehemence what he lacked in semantic efficiency. Perhaps he was effective; their keeper slowed to a fast walk, letting the others go ahead. Another centaur dropped back and became a rear guard. One of the animated balloons, which had continued to hover over the herd, now drifted back and remained over Max and Ellie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pace was just bearable, between a fast walk and a dogtrot. The route led across the open, flat floor of the valley and through knee-high grass. The grass saved them somewhat, as the centaur leading them seemed to feel that a fall or two every few hundred yards represented optimum efficiency. He never seemed impatient and would stop and let them get up, but always started off again at a clip brisk for humans. Max and Ellie ceased trying to talk, their throats being burned dry by their panting efforts to keep up. A tiny stream meandered through the bottom of the valley; the centaur jumped easily across it. It was necessary for the humans to wade. Ellie paused in midstream, leaned down and started to drink. Max objected, "Ellie! Don't drink that--you don't know that it's safe." "I hope it poisons me so I can lie down and die. Max, I can't go much farther." "Chin up, kid. We'll get out of this. I've been keeping track of where we've gone." He hesitated, then drank also, being terribly thirsty. The centaur let them, then tugged them on. It was as far again to the rising ground and forest on the other side. They had thought that they were as tired as they could be before they started up hill; they were mistaken. The centaur was agile as a goat and seemed surprised that they found it difficult. Finally Ellie collapsed and would not get up; the centaur came back and stirred her roughly with a three-toed hoof. Max struck him with both fists. The centaur made no move to retaliate but looked at him with that same stupid astonishment. Their rear guard came up and conversed with it, after which they waited for perhaps ten minutes. Max sat down beside Ellie and said anxiously, "Feeling any better?" "Don't talk." Presently the guard edged between them and drove Max back by stepping on him, whereupon the other centaur tugged on Ellie's leash. It contracted and she was forced to scramble to her feet. The centaurs let them rest twice after that. After an endless time, when the local sun was dropping low in the west, they came out on flat table land, still heavily wooded. They continued through trees for a distance which Max's count of paces told him was under a mile but seemed like ten, then stopped. They were in a semi-clearing, a space carpeted with fallen needles. Their guard came up to the other centaur and took from him the end of Max's leash, flipped it around the base of a tree, to which it clung. The other centaur did the same with Ellie's leash to another tree about forty feet away. Having done so, they roughly urged the two together, while stopping to stroke their bonds until they were stretched out very thin. It allowed Max and Ellie enough slack that they might have passed each other. This did not seem to please the centaurs. One of them shifted Max's leash farther back into the surrounding bushes, dragging him with it. This time at the extreme limit allowed by their bonds they were about six feet apart. "What are they doing?" asked Ellie. "Looks like they don't want us to combine forces." Finished, the centaurs trotted away. Ellie looked after them, began to sob, then cried openly, tears running down her dirty face and leaving tracks. "Stow it," Max said harshly. "Sniffling will get us nowhere." "I can't help it," she bawled. "I've been brave all day--at least I've tried to be. I . . ." She collapsed face down and let herself go. By getting down prone and stretching Max could just reach her head. He patted her tangled hair. "Take it easy, kid," he said softly. "Cry it out, if you'll feel better." "Oh, Maxie! Tied up . . . like a dog." "We'll see about that." He sat up and examined his tether. Whatever the ropelike leash was, it was not rope. It had a smooth shiny surface which reminded him more of a snake, though the part that wound around his ankle showed no features; it simply flowed around his ankle and merged back into itself. He lifted the bight and detected a faint throbbing. He stroked it as he had seen the centaurs do and it responded with flowing pulsations, but it neither shrank nor grew longer, nor did it loosen its grip. "Ellie," he announced, "This thing is _alive_." She lifted a woebegone face. "What thing?" "This rope." "Oh, that! Of course." "At least," he went on, "if it isn't, it's not really dead." He tried his knife again, there was no effect. "I'll bet if I had a match I could make it cry 'Uncle.' Got an Everlite, Ellie?" "I don't smoke." "Neither do I. Well, maybe I can make a fire some other way. Rubbing two sticks together, or something." "Do you know how?" "No." He continued stroking and patting the living rope, but, though he always got a response in pulsations, he did not seem to have the right touch; the bond stayed as before. He was continuing this fruitless attempt when he heard his name called. "Max! Ellie!" Ellie sat up with a jerk. "Chipsie! Oh, Max, she followed us. Come here, darling!" The spider puppy was high above them in a tree. She looked carefully around, then scurried down, making the last ten feet a flying leap into Ellie's arms. They cuddled and made soft noises, then Ellie straightened up, her eyes shining. "Max, I feel so much better." "So do I." He added, "Though I don't know why." The spider puppy announced gravely, "Chipsie follow." Max reached across and petted her. "Yes, Chipsie did. Good girl!" Ellie hugged the spider puppy. "I don't feel deserted now, Max. Maybe everything will come out all right." "Look, Ellie, we're not in too bad a spot. Maybe I'll find the combination to tickle these ropes or snakes or whatever so they'll give up. If I do, we'll sneak back tonight." "How would we find our way?" "Don't worry. I watched every foot of the way, every change of direction, every landmark." "Even in the dark?" "Easier in the dark. I know these stars--I sure ought to. But suppose we don't get loose; we still aren't licked." "Huh? I don't relish spending my life tied to a tree." "You won't. Look--I think these things are just curious about us. They won't eat us, that's sure--they probably live on grass. Maybe they'll get bored and turn us loose. But if they don't, it'll be rough on them." "Huh? Why?" "Because of Mr. Walther and George Daigler--and Sam, Sam Anderson; that's why. They're probably beating the bushes for us right now. We are less than ten miles from the ship--five by a straight line. They'll find us. Then if these silly-looking centaurs want to get tough, they'll learn about modern weapons. They and their fool throwing ropes!" "It might take a long time to find us. Nobody knows where we went." "Yes," he admitted. "If I had a pocket radio. Or some way to signal. Or even a way to build a fire. But I don't." "I never thought. It just seemed like going for a stroll in the park." Max thought darkly that he had tried to warn her. Why, even the hills around home weren't safe if a body didn't keep his eyes peeled . . . you could run into a mean old bobcat, or even a bear. Person like Ellie never 'ud had enough hard knocks to knock sense into her, that was her trouble. Presently he admitted that he himself hadn't looked for grief from anything as apparently chuckled-headed and harmless as these centaur things. Anyhow, as Sam would say, no use cryin' over spilt milk when the horse was already stolen. "Ellie." "Huh?" "Do you suppose Chipsie could find her way back?" "Why, I don't know." "If she could, we could send a message." Chipsie looked up. "Back?" she inquired. "Please back. Go home." Ellie frowned. "I'm afraid Chipsie doesn't talk that well. She'd probably just hiccup and get incoherent." "I don't mean that. I know Chipsie is no mental giant. I . . ." "Chipsie is smart!" "Sure. But I want to send a written message and a map." He fumbled in a pocket, pulled out a stylus. "Do you have any paper?" "I'll see." She found a folded paper in a dungaree pocket. "Oh, dear! I was supposed to take this to Mr. Giordano. Mr. Hornsby will be so vexed with me." "What is it?" "A requisition for number-ten wire." "It doesn't matter now." He took the paper, scratched out the memorandum, turned it over and began to draw, stopping to consult the pictures filed in his mind for distances, which way the local sun lay, contours, and other details. "Max?" "Quiet, can't you?" He continued to sketch, then added: "URGENT--to First Officer Walther: Eldreth Coburn and self captured by centaurs. Be careful and watch out for their throwing ropes. Respectfully, M. Jones." He handed it to Ellie. "That ought to do it. Is there any way to fasten it to her? I sure don't want her to drop it." "Mmm . . . let me see. Turn your back, Max." "Why?" "Don't be difficult. Turn your back." He did so, shortly she said, "All right now." He faced her and she handed him a ribbon. "How's this?" "Swell!" They managed to tie the ribbon, with the note folded and firmly attached, around Mr. Chips' waist, anchoring it to a middle limb . . . not too easy as the spider puppy seemed to think it was a game and was ticklish as well. "There! Stop squirming, Chipsie, and listen. Ellie wants you to go home." "Home?" "Yes, home. Go back to the ship." "Ellie go home?" "Ellie can't go home." "No." "Honey, you've _got_ to." "No." "Look, Chipsie. You find Maggie and tell her Ellie said to give you some candy. You give Maggie this." She tugged at the tied note. "Candy?" "Go home. Find Maggie. Maggie will give you candy." "Ellie go home." "Please, Chipsie." "Ellie," Max said urgently, "something is coming." Eldreth looked up, saw a centaur coming through the trees. She pointed. "Look, Chipsie! They're coming! They'll catch Chipsie! Go home! Run!" The spider puppy squealed in terror and scurried for the trees. Once on a branch she looked back and whimpered. "Go home!" screamed Ellie. "Find Maggie!" Mr. Chips shot a glance at the centaur, then disappeared. They had no time to worry further, the centaur was almost up to them. He glanced at them and went on by; it was what followed the centaur that grabbed their attention. Ellie suppressed a shriek. "Max! They've caught everybody." "No," he corrected grimly. "Look again." The gathering gloom had caused him to make the same mistake; it seemed that the entire ship's company trotted after the centaur in single file, ankle leashed to ankle by living ropes. But only the first glance gave such an impression. These creatures were more than humanoid--but such degraded creatures had never sailed between the stars. They shuffled quickly along like well-trained animals. One or two looked at Ellie and Max in passing, but their stares were bovine, incurious. Small children not on leash trotted with their mothers, and once Max was startled to see a wrinkled little head peeping out of a pouch--these man-creatures were marsupials, too. Max controlled a desire to retch and as they passed out of sight he turned to Ellie. "Gosh!" "Max," Eldreth said hoarsely, "do you suppose we've died and gone to our punishment?" "Huh? Don't be silly. Things are bad enough." "I mean it. That was something right out of Dante's Inferno." Max was swallowing uneasily and not feeling good-tempered. "Look, you can pretend you're dead if you want to. Me, I'm alive and I mean to stay so. Those things weren't men. Don't let it throw you." "But they _were_ men. Men and women and children." "No, they weren't. Being shaped like us doesn't make them men. Being a man is something else entirely." He scowled. "Maybe the centaurs are 'men.'" "Oh, no--" "Don't be too sure. They seem to run things in this country." The discussion was cut short by another arrival. It was almost dark and they did not see the centaur until he entered their clearing. He was followed by three of the--Max decided to call them 'men' though he resented the necessity--followed by three men. They were not on leashes. All three were bearing burdens. The centaur spoke to them; they distributed what they carried. One of them set down a large clay bowl filled with water in the space separating Max and Ellie. It was the first artifact that any human had seen on Charity and did not indicate a high level of mechanical culture, being crudely modeled and clearly not thrown on a potter's wheel; it held water, no more could be said for it. A second porter dumped a double armful of small fruits beside the bowl. Two of them splashed into the bowl, he did not bother to fish them out. Max had to look twice to see what the third slave was carrying. It looked as if he had three large ovoid balls slung by ropes in each of his hands; second inspection showed them to be animals about the size of opossums which he carried by their tails. He went around the clearing, stopping every few feet and lifting one of his burdens to a lower branch. When he had finished they were surrounded by six small creatures, each hanging by its tail. The centaur followed the slave, Max saw him stroke each animal and press a spot on its neck. In each case the entire body of the little animal lit up, began to shine like a firefly with soft silvery light. The clearing was softly illuminated thereby--well enough, Max thought, to read large print. One of the hobgoblins balloons came sailing silently between trees and anchored to a point thirty feet above them; it seemed to settle down for the night. The centaur came over to Max and prodded him with a hoof, snorting inquiringly. Max listened carefully, then repeated the sound. The centaur answered and again Max mimicked. This useless exchange continued for a few phrases, then the centaur gave up and left, his train trotting after him. Ellie shivered. "Phew!" she exclaimed, "I'm glad they're gone. I can stand the centaurs, a little, but those men . . . ugh!" He shared her disgust; they looked less human close up, having hair lines that started where their eyebrows should have been. They were so flat-headed that their ears stuck up above their skulls. But it was not this that had impressed Max. When the centaur had spoken to him Max had gotten his first good look into a centaur's mouth. Those teeth were never meant for munching grain, they were more like the teeth of a tiger--or a shark. He decided not to mention this. "Say, wasn't that the same one that was leading the herd that caught us?" "How would I know? They all look alike." "But they don't, any more than two horses look alike." "Horses all look alike." "But . . ." He stopped, baffled by a city viewpoint at which communication failed. "I think it was the same one." "I can't see that it matters." "It might. I'm trying to learn their language." "I heard you swallowing your tonsils. How did you do that?" "Oh, you just remember what a sound sounds like, then do it." He threw his head back and made a very plaintive sound. "What was _that?_" "A shote stuck in a fence. Little shote by the name of Abner I had once." "It sounds tragic." "It was, until I helped him loose. Ellie, I think they've bedded us down for the night." He gestured at the bowl and the fruit beside it. "Like feeding the hogs." "Don't put it that way. Room service. Room service and maid service and lights. Food and drink." She picked up one of the fruits. It was about the size and shape of a cucumber. "Do you suppose this is fit to eat?" "I don't think you ought to try it. Ellie, it would be smart not to eat or drink anything until we are rescued." "Well, maybe we could go hungry but we certainly can't go without water. You die of thirst in a day or two." "But we may be rescued before morning." "Maybe." She peeled the fruit. "It smells good. Something like a banana." He peeled one and sniffed it. "More like a pawpaw." "Well?" "Mmm-- Look here, I'll eat one. If it hasn't made me sick in a half hour, then you can try one." "Yes, sir, boss man." She bit into the one she held. "Mind the seeds." "Ellie, you're a juvenile delinquent." She wrinkled her nose and smiled. "You say the sweetest things! I try to be." Max bit into his. Not bad--not as much flavor as a pawpaw, but not bad. Some minutes later he was saying, "Maybe we should leave some for breakfast?" "All right. I'm full anyway." Ellie leaned over and drank. Without words they had each concluded that the cloying meal required them to risk the water. "There, I feel better. At least we'll die comfortably. Max? Do you think we dare sleep? I'm dead." "I think they are through with us for the night. You sleep, I'll sit up." "No, that's not fair. Honest, what good would it do to keep watch? We can't get away." "Well . . . here, take my knife. You can sleep with it in your hand." "All right." She reached across the bowl and accepted it. "Good night, Max. I'm going to count sheep." "Good night." He stretched out, shifted and got a tree cone out of his ribs, then tried to relax. Fatigue and a full stomach helped, the knowledge of their plight hindered--and that hobgoblin hanging up there. Maybe _it_ was keeping watch--but not for their benefit. "Max? Are you asleep?" "No, Ellie." "Hold my hand? I'm _scared_." "I can't reach it." "Yes, you can. Swing around the other way." He did so, and found that he could reach over his head past the water bowl and clasp her hand. "Thanks, Max. Good night some more." He lay on his back and stared up through the trees. Despite the half light given by the luminiferous animals he could see stars and the numerous meteor trails crisscrossing the sky. To avoid thinking he started counting them. Presently they started exploding in his head and he was asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light of the local sun through the trees awakened him. He raised his head. "I wondered how long you would sleep," Eldreth announced. "Look who's here." He sat up, wincing with every move, and turned around. Mr. Chips was sitting on Ellie's middle and peeling one of the papaya-like fruits. "Lo, Maxie." "Hello, Chipsie." He saw that the note was still tied to her. "Bad girl!" Mr. Chips turned to Ellie for comfort. Tears started to leak out. "No, no," corrected Ellie. "Good girl. She's promised to go find Maggie as soon as she finishes breakfast. Haven't you, dear?" "Go find Maggie," the spider puppy agreed. "Don't blame her, Max. Spider puppies aren't nocturnal back home. She just waited until we were quiet, then came back. She couldn't help it. I found her sleeping in my arm." The spider puppy finished eating, then drank daintily from the bowl. Max decided that it didn't matter, considering who had probably used it before they had. This thought he suppressed quickly. "Find Maggie," Mr. Chips announced. "Yes, dear. Go straight back to the ship as fast as you can and find Maggie. Hurry." "Find Maggie. Hurry fast. 'Bye, Maxie." The spider puppy took to the trees and scampered away in the right direction. "Do you think she'll get there?" asked Max. "I think so. After all, her ancestors found their way through forests and such for a lot of generations. She knows it's important; we had a long talk." "Do you really think she understands that much?" "She understands about pleasing me and that's enough. Max, do you suppose they can possibly reach us today? I don't want to spend another night here." "Neither do I. If Chipsie can move faster than we can . . ." "Oh, she can." "Then maybe--if they start quickly." "I hope so. Ready for breakfast?" "Did Chipsie leave anything?" "Three apiece. I've had mine. Here." "Sure you're lying? There were only five when we went to sleep." She looked sheepish and allowed him to split the odd one. While they were eating he noticed a change. "Hey, what became of the over-sized lightning bugs?" "Oh. One of those awful creatures came at dawn and carried them away. I was set to scream but he didn't come close to me, so I let you sleep." "Thanks. I see our chaperone is with us." The hobgoblin still hung in the tree tops. "Yes, and there have been peekers around all morning, too." "Did you get a look at one?" "Of course not." She stood up, stretched and winced. "Now to see what beautiful surprises this lovely day brings forth." She made a sour face. "The program I would pick is to sit right here and never lay eyes on anything until George Daigler shows up with about a dozen armed men. I'd kiss him. I'd kiss all of them." "So would I." Until well past noon Eldreth's chosen schedule prevailed, nothing happened. They heard from time to time the bugling and snorting of centaurs but saw none. They talked in desultory fashion, having already disposed of both hopes and fears, and were dozing in the sunshine, when they suddenly came alert to the fact that a centaur was entering the clearing. Max felt sure that it was the leader of the herd, or at least that it was the one who had fed and watered them. The creature wasted no time, making it clear with kicks and prods that they were to allow themselves to be leashed for travel. Never once were they free of the living ropes. Max thought of attacking the centaur, perhaps leaping on his back and cutting his throat. But it seemed most unlikely that he could do it quietly enough; one snort might bring the herd down on them. Besides which he knew no way to get free of their bonds even if he killed the centaur. Better wait--especially with a messenger gone for help. They were led, falling and being dragged occasionally, along the route taken by the party of slaves. It became apparent that they were entering a large centaur settlement. The path opened out into a winding, well-tended road with centaurs going both directions and branching off onto side roads. There were no buildings, none of the outward marks of a civilized race--but there was an air of organization, of custom, of stability. Little centaurs scampered about, got in the way, and were ordered aside. There was activity of various sorts on both sides of the road and grotesque human slaves were almost as numerous as centaurs, carrying burdens, working in unexplained fashions--some with living-rope bonds, some allowed to run free. They could not see much because of the uncomfortable pace they were forced to maintain. Once Max noted an activity on his side of the road that he wished to see better. He did not mention it to Ellie, not only because talking was difficult but because he did not wish to worry her--but it had looked like an outdoor butcher shop to him. The hanging carcasses were not centaurs. They stopped at last in a very large clearing, well filled with centaurs. Their master patted the lines that bound them and thereby caused them to shorten until they were fetched close to his sides. He then took his place in a centaur queue. A large, grizzled, and presumably elderly centaur was holding court on one side of the "square." He stood with quiet dignity as single centaurs or groups came in succession before him. Max watched with interest so great that he almost lost his fear. Each case would be the cause of much discussion, then the centaur chieftain would make a single remark and the case would be over. The contestants would leave quietly. The conclusion was inescapable that law or custom was being administered, with the large centaur as arbiter. There was none of the travesties of men in the clearing but there were underfoot odd animals that looked like flattened-out hogs. Their legs were so short that they seemed more like tractor treads. They were mostly mouth and teeth and snuffling snouts, and whatever they came to, if it was not a centaur's hoof, they devoured. Max understood from watching them how the area, although thickly inhabited, was kept so clean; these scavengers were animated street cleaners. Their master gradually worked up toward the head of the line. The last case before theirs concerned the only centaur they had seen which did not seem in vibrant health. He was old and skinny, his coat was dull and his bones stuck pitifully through his hide. One eye was blind, a blank white; the other was inflamed and weeping a thick ichor. The judge, mayor, or top herd leader discussed his case with two younger healthy centaurs who seemed to be attending him almost as nurses. Then the boss centaur moved from his position of honor and walked around the sick one, inspecting him from all sides. Then he spoke to him. The old sick one responded feebly, a single snorted word. The chief centaur spoke again, got what seemed to Max the same answer. The chief backed into his former position, set up a curious whinnying cry. From all sides the squatty scavengers converged on the spot. They formed a ring around the sick one and his attendants, dozens of them, snuffling and grunting. The chief bugled once; one attendant reached into its pouch and hauled forth a creature curled into a knot, the centaur stroked it and it unwound. To Max it looked unpleasantly like an eel. The attendant extended it toward the sick centaur. It made no move to stop him, but waited, watching with his one good eye. The head of the slender thing was suddenly touched to the neck of the sick centaur; he jerked in the characteristic convulsion of electric shock and collapsed. The chief centaur snorted once--and the scavengers waddled forward with surprising speed, swarming over the body and concealing it. When they backed away, still snuffling, there were not even bones. Max called out softly, "Steady, Ellie! Get a grip on yourself, kid." She answered faintly, "I'm all right."</p>
<p class="calibre1">19</p>
<p class="calibre1">A FRIEND IN NEED</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time they were turned loose. Their master tickled their bonds, which dropped from their ankles. Max said softly to Ellie, "If you want to run for it, I'll keep them busy." Ellie shook her head. "No good. They'd have me before I went fifty feet. Besides--I can't find my way back." Max shut up, knowing that she was right but having felt obliged to offer. The chief centaur inspected them with the characteristic expression of gentle surprise, exchanged bugling comments with their captor. They were under discussion for some time, there appeared to be some matter to be decided. Max got out his knife. He had no plan, other than a determination that no centaur would approach either one of them with that electric-shock creature, or any other menace, without a fight. The crisis faded away. Their captor flicked their leashes about their ankles and dragged them off. Fifteen minutes later they were again staked out in the clearing they had occupied. Ellie looked around her after the centaur had gone and sighed. "'Be it ever so humble . . .' Max, it actually feels good to get back here." "I know." The monotony that followed was varied by one thing only: fading hope and mounting despair. They were not treated unkindly; they were simply domestic animals--fed and watered and largely ignored. Once a day they were given water and plenty of the native papayas. After the first night they no longer had the luxury of "artificial" light, nor did the hobgoblin hang over their clearing. But there was no way of escape, short of gnawing off a leg and crawling away. For two or three days they discussed the possibility of rescue with mounting anxiety, then, having beaten the subject to death they dropped it; it simply added to their distress. Ellie rarely smiled now and she had quit her frivolous back talk; it seemed that it had finally gotten through her armor that this could happen to Eldreth Coburn, only daughter of the rich and almost all-powerful Mr. Commissioner Coburn--a chattel, a barnyard animal of monsters themselves suitable only for zoos. Max took it a little more philosophically. Never having had much, he did not expect much--not that he enjoyed it. He kept his worst fear secret. Ellie referred to their status as "animals in a zoo" because most of their visitors were small centaurs who came sniffling and bleating around with a curiosity that their elders seemed to lack. He let her description stand because he believed their status worse than that--he thought that they were being fattened for the table. One week after their capture Eldreth declined to eat breakfast and stayed silent all morning. All that Max could think of to say evoked only monosyllables. In desperation he said, "I'll beat you at three-dee and spot you two starships." That roused her. "You and who else?" she said scornfully. "And with what?" "Well, we could play it in our heads. You know-- blindfold." She shook her head. "No good. You'd claim your memory was better than mine and I wouldn't be able to prove you were cheating." "Nasty little brat." She smiled suddenly. "That's better. You've been too gentle with me lately--it depresses me. Max, we could make a set." "How?" "With these." She picked up one of many tree cones that littered the clearing. "A big one is a flagship. We can pick various sizes and break the thingamajigs off and such." They both got interested. The water bowl was moved aside so that it no longer occupied the center of the space marked by the limits of their tethers and the no-man's-land between them was brushed free of needles and marked with scratches as boards. The boards had to be side by side; they must stack them in their minds, but that was a common expedient for players with good visualization when using an unpowered set--it saved time between moves. Pebbles became robots; torn bits of cloth tied to cones distinguished sides and helped to designate pieces. By midafternoon they were ready. They were still playing their first game when darkness forced them to stop. As they lay down to sleep Max said, "I'd better not take your hand. I'd knock over men in the dark." "I won't sleep if you don't--I won't feel safe. Besides, that gorilla messed up one board changing the water." "That's all right. I remember where they were." "Then you can just remember where they all are, Stretch out your arm." He groped in the darkness, found her fingers. "Night, Max. Sleep tight." "Good night, Ellie." Thereafter they played from sunup to sundown. Their owner came once, watched them for an hour, went away without a snort. Once when Ellie had fought him to a draw Max said, "You know, Ellie, you play this game awfully well--for a girl." "Thank you too much." "No, I mean it. I suppose girls are probably as intelligent as men, but most of them don't act like it. I think it's because they don't have to. If a girl is pretty, she doesn't have to think. Of course, if she can't get by on her looks, then--well, take you for example. If you . . ." "_Oh!_ So I'm ugly, Mr. Jones!" "Wait a minute. I didn't say that. Let's suppose that you were the most beautiful woman since Helen of Troy. In that case, you would . . ." He found that he was talking to her back. She had swung round, grabbed her knees, and was ignoring him. He stretched himself to the limit of his tether, bound leg straight out behind him, and managed to touch her shoulder. "Ellie?" She shook off his hand. "Keep your distance! You smell like an old goat." "Well," he said reasonably, "you're no lily yourself. You haven't had a bath lately either." "I know it!" she snapped, and started to sob. "And I hate it. I just . . . h- h- _hate_ it. I look _awful_." "No, you don't. Not to. me." She turned a tear-wet and very dirty face. "Liar." "Nothing wrong that some soap and water won't fix." "Oh, if only I had some." She looked at him. "You aren't at your best yourself, Mr. Jones. You need a haircut and the way your beard grows in patches is ghastly." He fingered the untidy stubble on his chin. "I can't help it." "Neither can I." She sighed. "Set up the boards again." Thereafter she beat him three straight games, one with a disgraceful idiot's mate. He looked at the boards sadly when it was over. "And you are the girl who flunked improper fractions?" "Mr. Jones, has it ever occurred to you, the world being what it is, that women sometimes prefer not to appear too bright?" He was digesting this when she added, "I learned this game at my father's knee, before I learned to read. I was junior champion of Hespera before I got shanghaied. Stop by sometime and I'll show you my cup." "Is that true? Really?" "I'd rather play than eat--when I can find competition. But you're learning. Someday you'll be able to give me a good game." "I guess I don't understand women." "That's an understatement." Max was a long time getting to sleep that night. Long after Eldreth was gently snoring he was still staring at the shining tail of the big comet, watching the shooting star trails, and thinking. None of his thoughts was pleasant. Their position was hopeless, he admitted. Even though Chipsie had failed (he had never pinned much hope on her), searching parties should have found them by now. There was no longer any reason to think that they would be rescued. And now Ellie was openly contemptuous of him. He had managed to hurt her pride again--again with his big, loose, flapping jaw! Why, he should have told her that she was the prettiest thing this side of paradise, if it would make her feel good--she had mighty little to feel good about these days! Being captive had been tolerable because of her, he admitted--now he had nothing to look forward to but day after day of losing at three-dee while Ellie grimly proved that girls were as good as men and better. At the end of it they would wind up as an item in the diet of a thing that should never have been born. If only Dr. Hendrix hadn't died! If only he had been firm with Ellie when it mattered. To top it off, and at the moment almost the worst of all, he felt that if he ate just one more of those blasted pawpaws it would gag him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was awakened by a hand on his shoulder and a whisper in his ear. "Max!" "What the--?" "_Quiet!_ Not a sound." It was Sam crouching over him--Sam! As he sat up, sleep jarred out of him by adrenalin shock, he saw Sam move noiselessly to where Ellie slept. He squatted over her but did not touch her. "Miss Eldreth," he said softly. Ellie's eyes opened and stared. She opened her mouth, Max was terrified that she might cry out. Sam hastily signed for silence; she looked at him and nodded. Sam knelt over her, seemed to study something in the shadow-laced moonlight, then took out a hand gun. There was the briefest of low-energy discharges, entirely silent, and Ellie stood up--free. Sam returned to Max. "Hold still," he whispered. "I don't want to burn you." He knelt over Max's bound ankle. When the gun flared Max felt an almost paralyzing constriction around his ankle, then the thing fell off. The amputated major part contracted and jerked away into the shadows. Max stood up. "How--" "Not a word. Follow me." Sam led off into the bushes with Ellie behind him and Max following closely. They had gone only twenty yards when there was a whimpering cry of "Ellie!" and the spider puppy landed in Eldreth's arms. Sam turned suddenly. "Keep her quiet," he whispered, "for your life." Ellie nodded and started petting the little creature, crooning to it voicelessly. When Chipsie tried to talk, she silenced it, then stuffed it inside her shirt. Sam waited these few moments, now started on without speaking. They proceeded for several hundred yards as near silently as three people who believe their lives hang on it can manage. Finally Sam stopped. "This is as far as we dare go," he said in a low voice. "Any farther in the dark and I'd be lost. But I'm pretty sure we are outside their sleeping grounds. We'll start again at the first light." "How did you get here in the dark, then?" "I didn't. Chips and I have been hiding in thick bushes since midafternoon, not fifty feet from you." "Oh." Max looked around, looked up at the stars. "I can take us back in the dark." "You can? It 'ud be a darn good thing. These babies don't stir out at night--I think." "Let me get in the lead. You get behind Ellie." It took more than an hour to get to the edge of the tableland. The darkness, the undergrowth, the need for absolute silence, and the fact that Max had to take it slowly to keep his bearings despite his photographic memory all slowed them down. The trip downhill into the valley was even slower. When they reached the edge of the trees with comparatively flat grassland in front Sam halted them and surveyed the valley by dim moonlight. "Mustn't get caught in the open," he whispered. "They can't throw those snakes too well among trees, but out in the open--oh, brother!" "You know about the throwing ropes?" "Sure." "Sam," whispered Ellie. "Mr. Anderson, why did . . ." "Sssh!" he cautioned. "Explanations later. Straight across, at a dogtrot. Miss Eldreth, you set the pace. Max, pick your bearings and guide us. We'll run side by side. All set?" "Just a minute." Max took the spider puppy from Eldreth, zipping it inside his shirt as she had done. Mr. Chips did not even wake up, but moaned softly like a disturbed baby. "Okay." They ran and walked and ran again for a half hour or more, wasting no breath on words, putting everything into gaining distance from the centaur community. Knee-high grass and semi-darkness made the going hard. They were almost to the bottom of the valley and Max was straining to spot the stream when Sam called out, "Down! Down flat!" Max hit dirt, taking it on his elbows to protect Chips; Ellie flopped beside him. Max turned his head cautiously and whispered, "Centaurs?" "No. Shut up." A hobgoblin balloon, moving at night to Max's surprise, was drifting across the valley at an altitude of about a hundred feet. Its course would take it past them, missing them by perhaps a hundred yards. Then it veered and came toward them. It lost altitude and hovered almost over them. Max saw Sam aim carefully, steadying his pistol with both bands. There was momentarily a faint violet pencil from gun to hobgoblin; the creature burst and fell so close by that Max could smell burned meat. Sam returned his weapon and got to his feet. "One less spy," he said with satisfaction. "Let's get going, kids." "You think those things spy?" "'Think'? We know. Those polo ponies have this place _organized_. Pipe down and make miles." Ellie found the stream by falling into it. They hauled her out and waded across, stopping only to drink. On the other bank Sam said, "Where's your left shoe, Miss Eldreth?" "It came off in the brook." Sam stopped to search but it was useless; the water looked like ink in the faint light. "No good," he decided. "We could waste the whole night. You're due for sore feet--sorry. Better throw away your other shoe." It did not slow them until they reached the far ridge beyond which lay Charityville and the ship. Soon after they started up Ellie cut her right foot on a rock. She did her best, setting her jaw and not complaining, but it handicapped them. There was a hint of dawn in the air by the time they reached the top. Max started to lead them down the arroyo that he and Ellie had come up so many year-long days ago. Sam stopped him. "Let me get this straight. This isn't the draw that faces the ship, is it?" "No, that one is just north of this." Max reconstructed in his mind how it had looked from the ship and compared it with his memory of the photomap taken as the ship landed. "Actually a shoulder just beyond the next draw faces the ship." "I thought so. This is the one Chips led me up, but I want us to stay in the trees as long as possible. It'll be light by the time we'd be down to the flat." "Does it matter? There have never been any centaurs seen in the valley the ship is in." "You mean you never saw any. You've been away, old son. We're in danger now--and in worse danger the closer we get to the ship. Keep your voice down-- and lead us to that shoulder that sticks out toward the ship. If you can." Max could, though it meant going over strange terrain and keeping his bearings from his memory of a small-scale map. It involved "crossing the furrows," too, instead of following a dry water course--which led to impasses such as thirty-foot drops that had to be gone painfully around. Sam grew edgy as the light increased and urged them to greater speed and greater silence even as Ellie's increasingly crippled condition made his demands harder to meet. "I really am sorry," he whispered after she had to slide and scramble down a rock slope, checking herself with bare and bloody feet. "But it's better to get there on stumps than to let them catch you." "I know." Her face contorted but she made no sound. It was daylight by the time Max led them out on the shoulder. Silently he indicated the ship, a half mile away. They were about level with its top. "Down this way, I think," he said quietly to Sam. "No." "Huh?" "Chilluns, it's Uncle Sam's opinion that we had better lie doggo in those bushes, holding still and letting the beggar flies bite us, until after sundown." Max eyed the thousand yard gap. "We could run for it." "And four legs run faster than two legs. We've learned that lately." The bushes selected by Sam grew out to the edge of the shoulder. He crawled through them until he reached a place where he could spy the valley below while still hidden. Ellie and Max wriggled after him. The ground dropped off sharply just beyond them. The ship faced them, to their left and nearer was Charityville. "Get comfortable," Sam ordered, "and we'll take turns keeping guard. Sleep if you can, this will be a long watch." Max tried to shift Mr. Chips around so that he might lie flat. A little head poked out of his collar. "Good morning," the spider puppy said gravely. "Breakfast?" "No breakfast, hon," Ellie told her. "Sam, is it all right to let her out?" "I guess so. But keep her quiet." Sam was studying the plain below. Max did the same. "Sam? Why don't we head for the village? It's closer." "Nobody there. Abandoned." "What? Look, Sam, can't you tell us now what's happened?" Sam did not take his eyes off the plain. "Okay. But hold it down to whispers. What do you want to know?" That was a hard one--Max wanted to know everything. "What happened to the village?" "Gave it up. Too dangerous." "Huh? Anybody caught?" "Not permanently. Daigler had a gun. But then the fun began. We thought that all they had were those throwing snakes and that we had scared them off. But they've got lots more than that. Things that burrow underground, for example. That's why the village had to be abandoned." "Anybody hurt?" "Well . . . the newlyweds were already in residence. Becky Weberbauer is a widow." Ellie gasped and Sam whispered sharply to be quiet. Max mulled it over before saying, "Sam, I don't see why, after they got my message, they didn't . . ." "What message?" Max explained. Sam shook his head. "The pooch got back all right. By then we knew you were missing and were searching for you--armed, fortunately. But there was no message." "Huh? How did you find us?" "Chips led me, I told you. But that was all. Somebody stuffed her into her old cage and that's where I found her yesterday. I stopped to pet her, knowing you were gone, Miss Eldreth--and found the poor little thing nearly out of her mind. I finally got it through my head that she knew where you two were. So . . ." He shrugged. "Oh. But I can't see," Max whispered, "why you risked it alone. You already knew they were dangerous; you should have had every man in the ship with you, armed." Sam shook his head. "And we would have lost every man. A sneak was possible; the other wasn't. And we had to get you back." "Thanks. I don't know how to say it, Sam. Anyhow, thanks." "Yes," added Ellie, "and stop calling me 'Miss Eldreth.' I'm Ellie to my friends." "Okay, Ellie. How are the feet?" "I'll live." "Good." He turned his head to Max. "But I didn't say we _wanted_ to get you back, I said we _had_ to. You, Max. No offense, Ellie." "Huh? Why me?" "Well . . ." Sam seemed reluctant. "You'll get the details when you get back. But it looks like you'll be needed if they take the ship off. You're the only astrogator left." "Huh? What happened to Simes?" "_Quiet!_ He's dead." "For Pete's sake." Max decided that, little as he liked Simes, death at the hands of the centaurs he would not have wished on any human; he said so. "Oh, no, it wasn't that way. You see, when Captain Blaine died . . ." "The Captain, _too?_" "Yes." "I knew he was sick, I didn't know he was that sick." "Well, call it a broken heart. Or honorable hara-kiri. Or an accident. I found an empty box for sleeping pills when I helped pack his things. Maybe he took them, or maybe your pal Simes slipped them in his tea. The Surgeon certified 'natural causes' and that's how it was logged. What is a natural cause when a man can't bear to live any longer?" Ellie said softly, "He was a good man." "Yes," agreed Sam. "Too good, maybe." "But how about Simes?" "Well, now, that was another matter. Simes seemed to feel that he was crown prince, but the First wouldn't stand for it. Something about some films the Chief Computerman had. Anyhow, he tried to get tough with Walther and I sort of broke his neck. There wasn't time to be gentle," Sam added hastily. "Simes pulled a gun." "Sam! You aren't in trouble?" "None, except here and now. If we--quiet, kids!" He peered more sharply through the bushes. "Not a sound, not a movement," he whispered. "It may miss us." A hobgoblln was drifting down from north, paralleling the ridge above and out from it, as if it were scouting the high land. Max said in Sam's ear, "Hadn't we better scrunch back?" "Too late. Just hold still." The balloon drifted abreast of them, stopped, then moved slowly toward them. Max saw that Sam had his gun out. He held his fire until the hobgoblin hovered above them. The shot burned needles and branches but it brought down the thing. "Sam! There's another one!" "Where?" Sam looked where Max pointed. The second hobgoblin apparently had been covering the first, higher and farther out. Even as they watched it veered away and gained altitude. "Get it, Sam!" Sam stood up. "Too late. Too far and too late. Well, kids, away we go. No need to keep quiet. Sit down and slide, Ellie; it'll save your feet some." Down they went, scattering rocks and tearing their clothes, with Mr. Chips on her own and enjoying it. At the bottom Sam said, "Max, how fast can you do a half mile?" "I don't know. Three minutes." "Make it less. Get going. I'll help Ellie." "No." "You get there! You're needed." "No!" Sam sighed. "Always some confounded hero. Take her other arm." They made a couple of hundred yards half carrying Eldreth, when she shook them off. "I can go faster alone," she panted. "Okay, let's go!" Sam rasped. She proved herself right. Ignoring her injured feet she pumped her short legs in a fashion which did not require Max's best speed to keep up, but nevertheless kept him panting. The ship grew larger ahead of them. Max saw that the cage was up and wondered how long it would take to attract attention and get it lowered. They were half way when Sam shouted, "Here comes the cavalry! Speed it up!" Max glanced over his shoulder. A herd of centaurs--a dozen, two dozen, perhaps more--was sweeping toward them from the hills on a diagonal plainly intended to cut them off. Ellie saw them too and did speed up, with a burst that momentarily outdistanced Max. They had cut the distance to a few hundred yards when the cage swung free of the lock and sank lazily toward the ground. Max started to shout that they were going to make it when he heard the drum of hooves close behind. Sam yelled, "Beat it, kids! Into the ship." He stopped. Max stopped too, while shouting, "_Run_, Ellie! Sam snarled, "Run for it, I said! What can _you_ do? Without a gun?" Max hesitated, torn by an unbearable decision. He saw that Ellie had stopped. Sam glanced back, then backhanded Max across the mouth. "Get moving! Get her inside!" Max moved, gathering Ellie in one arm and urging her on. Behind them Sam Anderson turned to face his death . . . dropping to one knee and steadying his pistol over his left forearm in precisely the form approved by the manual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">20</p>
<p class="calibre1">"--A SHIP IS NOT JUST STEEL--"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cage hit the ground, four men swarmed out as Max stumbled inside and dumped Ellie on the floor. The door clanged shut behind them, but not too quickly for Mr. Chips. The spider puppy ran to Ellie, clutched her arm and wailed. Eldreth tried to sit up. "You all right?" Max demanded. "Uh, sure. But . . ." She shut up as Max whirled around and tried to open the cage door. It would not open. It was not until then that he realized that the lift was off the ground and rising slowly. He punched the "stop" control. Nothing happened, the car continued upward. About ten feet off the ground it stopped. Max looked up through the grille roof and shouted, "Hey! In the lock, there! Lower away!" He was ignored. He tried the door again--uselessly, as its safety catch prevented it being opened when the cage was in the air. Frustrated and helpless, he grabbed the bars and looked out. He could see nothing of Sam. The centaurs were milling around in the middle distance. He saw one stumble and go down and then another. Then he saw the four men who had passed him. They were on their bellies in fair skirmish line not far from the cage, each with a shoulder gun and each firing carefully. The range was not great, about three hundred yards; they were taking steady toll. Each silent, almost invisible bolt picked off a centaur. Max counted seven more centaur casualties--then the monsters broke and ran, scattering toward the hills. The firing continued and several more dropped before distance made firing uncertain. Somebody shouted, "Hold your fire!" and one of the men stumbled to his feet and ran toward the center of the battle. The others got up and followed him. When they came back they were carrying something that looked like a bundle of clothing. The cage lowered to the ground, they came inside and laid it gently on the floor. One of them glanced at Eldreth, then quickly removed his jacket and laid it over Sam's face. Not until then did Max see that it was Mr. Walther. The other three were Mr. Daigler, a power man whom Max knew only by sight, and Chief Steward Giordano. The fat man was crying openly. "The filthy vermin!" he sobbed. "He never had a chance. They just rode him down and trompled him." He choked, then added, "But he got at least five of 'em." His eyes rested on Max without recognition. "He made 'em pay." Eldreth said gently, "Is he dead?" "Huh? Of course. Don't talk silly." The steward turned his face away. The car bumped to a stop. Walther looked in through the lock and said angrily, "Get those bystanders out of the way. What is this? A circus?" He turned back. "Let's get him in, men." As he was bending to help, Max saw Eldreth being led away by Mrs. Dumont. Tenderly they carried Sam in and deposited him on the deck where the Surgeon was waiting. Walther straightened up and seemed to notice Max for the first time. "Mr. Jones? Will you see me in my stateroom as quickly as possible, please?" "Aye aye, sir. But . . ." Max looked down at his friend. "I'd like to . . ." Walther cut him short. "There's nothing you can do. Come away." He added more gently, "Make it fifteen minutes. That will give you time for a wash and a change." Max presented himself on time, showered, his face hastily scraped, and in clean clothes--although lacking a cap. His one cap was somewhere in the far valley, lost on capture. He found Chief Engineer Compagnon and Mr. Samuels, the Purser, with the First Officer. They were seated around a table, having coffee. "Come in, Mr. Jones," Walther invited. "Sit down. Coffee?" "Uh, yes, sir." Max discovered that he was terribly hungry. He loaded the brew with cream and sugar. They sat for a few minutes, talking of unimportant matters, while Max drank his coffee and steadied down. Presently Walther said, "What shape are you in, Mr. Jones?" "Why, all right, I guess, sir. Tired, maybe." "I imagine so. I'm sorry to have to disturb you. Do you know the situation now?" "Partly, sir. Sam told me . . . Sam Anderson . . ." His voice broke. "We're sorry about Anderson," Mr. Walther said soberly. "In many ways he was one of the best men I ever served with. But go on." Max recounted what Sam had had time to tell him, but shortened the statements about Simes and Captain Blaine to the simple fact that they were dead. Walther nodded. "Then you know what we want of you?" "I think so, sir. You want to raise the ship, so you want me to astrogate." He hesitated. "I suppose I can." "Mmm . . . yes. But that's not all." "Sir?" "You must be Captain."</p>
<p class="calibre1">All three had their eyes fixed on him. Max felt lightheaded and for a moment wondered what was wrong. Their faces seemed to swell and then recede. He realized vaguely that he had had little to eat and almost no sleep for many hours and had been running on nerve--yes, that must be what was wrong with him. From a long distance away he heard Walther's voice: ". . . utterly necessary to leave this planet without delay. Now our legal position is clear. In space, only an astrogation officer may command. You are being asked to assume command responsibility while very young but you are the only qualified person-- therefore you _must_ do it." Max pulled himself together, the wavering figures came into focus. "Mr. Walther?" "Yes?" "But I'm not an astrogator. I'm just a probationary apprentice. Chief Engineer Compagnon answered him. "Kelly says you're an astrogator," he growled. "Kelly is more of an astrogator than I am!" Compagnon shook his head. "You can't pass judgment on yourself." Samuels nodded agreement. "Let's dispose of that," Walther added. "There is no question of the Chief Computerman becoming captain. Nor does your rank in your guild matter. Line of command, underway, necessarily is limited to astrogators. You are senior in that line, no matter how junior you feel. At this moment, I hold command--until I pass it on. But I can't take a ship into space. If you refuse . . . well, I don't know what we will have to do. I don't know." Max gulped and said, "Look, sir, I'm not refusing duty. I'll astrogate--shucks, I suppose it's all right to call me the astrogator, under the circumstances. But there is no reason to pretend that I'm captain. You stay in command while I conn the ship. That's best, sir--I wouldn't know how to _act_ like a captain." Walther shook his head. "Not legally possible." Compagnon added, "I don't care about the legalities. But I know that responsibility can't be divided. Frankly, young fellow, I'd rather have Dutch as skipper than you--but he can't astrogate. I'd be delighted to have Doc Hendrix--but he's gone. I'd rather hold the sack myself than load it on you--but I'm a physicist and I know just enough of the math of astrogation to know that I couldn't in a lifetime acquire the speed that an astrogator _has_ to have. Not my temperament. Kelly says you've got it already. I've shipped with Kelly a good many years, I trust him. So it's your pidgin, son; you've got to take it--and the authority that goes with it. Dutch will help--we'll all help--but you can't duck out and hand him the sack." Mr. Samuels said quietly, "I don't agree with the Chief Engineer about the unimportance of legal aspects; most of these laws have wise reasons behind them. But I agree with what else he says. Mr. Jones, a ship is not just steel, it is a delicate political entity. Its laws and customs cannot be disregarded without inviting disaster. It will be far easier to maintain morale and discipline in this ship with a young captain--with all his officers behind him--than it would be to let passengers and crew suspect that the man who must make the crucial decisions, those life-and-death matters involving the handling of the ship, that this all-powerful man nevertheless can't be trusted to command the ship. No, sir, such a situation would frighten me; that is how mutinies are born." Max felt his heart pounding, his head was aching steadily. Walther looked at him grimly and said, "Well?" "I'll take it." He added, "I don't see what else I can do." Walther stood up. "What are your orders, Captain?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max sat still and tried to slow his heart. He pressed his fingers to throbbing temples and looked frightened. "Uh, continue with routine. Make preparations to raise ship." "Aye aye, sir." Walther paused, then added, "May I ask when the Captain plans to raise ship?" He was having trouble focusing again. "When? Not before tomorrow--tomorrow at noon. I've got to have a night's sleep." He thought to himself that Kelly and he could throw it into a parking orbit, which would get them away from the centaurs--then stop to figure out his next move. "I think that's wise, sir. We need the time." Compagnon stood up. "If the Captain will excuse me, sir, I'll get my department started." Samuels joined him. "Your cabin is ready, sir--I'll have your personal effects moved in in a few minutes." Max stared at him. He had not yet assimilated the side implications of his new office. Use Captain Blaine's holy of holies? Sleep in his bed? "Uh, I don't think that's necessary. I'm comfortable where I am." Samuels glanced at the First Officer, then said, "If you please, Captain, this is one of the things I was talking about when I said that a ship is a delicate political entity." "Eh?" Max thought about it, then suddenly felt both the burden descend on him and the strength to meet it. "Very well," he answered, his voice deepening. "Do it." "Yes, sir." Samuels looked at him. "Also, Captain--if you wish it--I'll have Lopez stop in and trim your hair." Max pushed locks back of his ear. "It _is_ shaggy, isn't it? Very well." The Purser and the Chief Engineer left. Max stood for a moment uncertainly, not sure what his next cue was in this new role. Walther said, "Captain? Can you spare me a few more minutes?" "Oh, certainly." They sat down and Walther poured more coffee. Max said, "Mr. Walther? Do you suppose we could ring the pantry and get some toast? I haven't eaten today." "Why, surely! Sorry, sir." Instead of ringing, the First Officer phoned and ordered a high tea. Then he turned to Max. "Captain, I didn't give you all the story--nor did I wish to until we were alone." "So?" "Don't misunderstand me. My turning over command to you did not depend on these other matters--nor is it necessary for your officers to know everything that the Captain knows . . . even your department heads." "Uh, I suppose not." Walther stared at his coffee. "Have you heard how Mr. Simes happened to die?" Max told him what little he had learned from Sam. Walther nodded. "That is essentially correct. Mmmm . . . It is not good to speak ill of the dead, but Simes was an unstable character. When Captain Blaine passed on, he took it for granted that he was immediately captain of this ship." "Well--I suppose it looked that way to him, from the legal standpoint." "Not at all! Sorry to correct you, Captain, but that is one hundred percent wrong." Max frowned. "I guess I'm dumb--but I thought that was the argument that was used on me?" "No, sir. The ship being on the ground, command devolved on me, the senior. I am not required to turn command over to an astrogator until--and _unless_-- the ship goes into space. Even then it is not automatically a matter of turning it over to the senior astrogating officer. I have a clearly defined responsibility, with numerous adjudicated cases in point: I must turn command over only to a man I believe can handle it. "Now I have long had doubts about Mr. Simes, his temperament, I mean. Nevertheless, in this emergency, I would have found it terribly hard not to turn command over to him, once it was decided to raise ship. But before we lost the Captain I had had occasion to dig into Mr. Simes' ability as an astrogator--partly as a result of a conversation with you. I talked with Kelly--as you have gathered, Kelly is very well thought of. I believe I know now how that last transition went sour; Kelly took pains to show me. That and the fact that Kelly told me bluntly that there wasn't a member of the Worry gang willing to go into space under Mr. Simes made me decide that, if it ever came up, I'd let this ship sit here forever before I would let Simes be captain. That was just thinking ahead; the Captain was sick and prudence forced me to consider possibilities. "Then the Captain did die--and Simes announced that he was captain. The fool even moved into the cabin and sent for me. I told him he was not in command and never would be. Then I left, got witnesses and took my chief of police along to eject him. You know what happened. Your life isn't the only one that Anderson saved; I owe him mine, too." Walther abruptly changed the subject. "That phenomenal trick of memory you do--computing without tables or reference books. Can you do it all the time?" "Uh? Why, yes." "Do you know all the tables? Or just some of them?" "I know all the standard tables and manuals that are what an astrogator calls his 'working tools.'" Max started to tell about his uncle, Walther interrupted gently. "If you please, sir. I'm glad to hear it. I'm _very_ glad to hear it. Because the only such books in this ship are the ones in your head."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly had missed the books, of course--not Walther. When he disclosed his suspicions to Walther the two conducted a search. When that failed, it was announced that one (but only one) set was missing; Walther had offered a reward, and the ship had been combed from stern to astrodome--no manuals. "I suppose he ditched them dirtside," Walther finished. You know where that leaves us--we're in a state of seige. And we'd find them only by accident if we weren't. So I'm very glad you have the same confidence in your memory that Kelly has." Max was beginning to have misgivings--it is one thing to do something as a stunt, quite another to do it of necessity. "It isn't that bad," he answered. "Perhaps Kelly never thought of it, but logarithms and binary translation tables can probably be borrowed from engineering--with those we could fudge up methods for any straight hop. The others are needed mostly for anomalous transitions." "Kelly thought of that, too. Tell me, Captain, how does a survey ship go back after it penetrates a newly located congruency?" "Huh? So _that_ is what you want me to do with the ship?" "It is not for me," Walther said formally, "to tell the Captain where to take his ship." Max said slowly, "I've thought about it. I've had a lot of time to think lately." He did not add that he had dwelt on it nights in captivity to save his reason. "Of course, we don't have the instruments that survey ships carry, nor does applied astrogation go much into the theory of calculating congruencies. And even some survey ships don't come back." "But . . ." They were interrupted by a knock on the door. A steward's mate came in and loaded the table with food. Max felt himself starting to drool. He spread a slice of toast with butter and jam, and took a big bite. "My, this is good!" "I should have realized. Have a banana, sir? They look quite good--I believe hydroponics has had to thin them out lately." Max shuddered. "I don't think I'll ever eat bananas again. Or pawpaws." "Allergic, Captain?" "Not exactly. Well . . . yes." He finished the toast and said, "About that possibility. I'll let you know later." "Very well, Captain."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly before the dinner hour Max stood in front of the long mirror in the Captain's bedroom and looked at himself. His hair was short again and two hours sleep had killed some of his fatigue. He settled a cap on his head at the proper angle--the name in the sweat band was "Hendrix"; he had found it laid out with one of his own uniforms to which captain's insignia had been added. The sunburst on his chest bothered him--that he was indeed captain he conceded, even though it seemed like a wild dream, but he had felt that he was not entitled to anything but the smaller sunburst and circle, despite his four stripes. Walther and Samuels had been respectful but firm, with Samuels citing precedents that Max could not check on. Max had given in. He looked at himself, braced his shoulders, and sighed. He might as well go face them. As he walked down the companionway to the lounge he heard the speakers repeating, "All hands! All passengers! Report to Bifrost Lounge!" The crowd made way for him silently. He went to the Captain's table--his table!--and sat down at its head. Walther was standing by the chair. "Good evening, Captain." "Evening, Mr. Walther." Ellie was seated across from him. She caught his eye and smiled. "Hello, Ellie." He felt himself blushing. "Good evening, Captain," she said firmly. She was dressed in the same high style she had worn the first time he had ever seen her in the lounge; it did not seem possible that this lady could be the same girl whose dirty face had looked at him over three-dee boards scratched in dirt. "Uh, how are your feet?" "Bandages and bedroom slippers. But the Surgeon did a fine job. I'll be dancing tomorrow." "Don't rush it." She looked at his stripes and his chest. "You should talk." Before he could answer the unanswerable Walther leaned over and said quietly, "We're ready, Captain." "Oh. Go ahead." Walther tapped on a water glass. The First Officer explained the situation in calm tones that made it seem reasonable, inevitable. He concluded by saying, ". . . and so, in accordance with law and the custom of space, I have relinquished my temporary command to your new captain. Captain Jones!" Max stood up. He looked around, swallowed, tried to speak, and couldn't. Then, as effectively as if it had been a dramatic pause and not desperation, he picked up his water tumbler and took a sip. "Guests and fellow crewmen," he said, "we can't stay here. You know that. I have been told that our Surgeon calls the system we are up against here 'symbiotic enslavement'-- like dog to man, only more so, and apparently covering the whole animal kingdom on this planet. Well, men aren't meant for slavery, symbiotic or any sort. But we are too few to win out now, so we must leave." He stopped for another sip and Ellie caught his eye, encouraging him. "Perhaps someday other men will come back--better prepared. As for us, I am going to try to take the _Asgard_ back through the . . . uh, 'hole' you might call it, where we came out. It's a chancy thing. No one is forced to come along--but it is the only possible way to get home. Anyone who's afraid to chance it will be landed on the north pole of planet number three--the evening star we have been calling 'Aphrodite.' You may be able to survive there, although it is pretty hot even at the poles. If you prefer that alternative, turn your names in this evening to the Purser. The rest of us will try to get home." He stopped, then said suddenly, "That's all," and sat down. There was no applause and he felt glumly that he had muffed his first appearance. Conversation started up around the room, crewmen left, and steward's mates quickly started serving. Ellie looked at him and nodded quietly. Mrs. Mendoza was on his left; she said, "Ma--I mean 'Captain'--is it really so dangerous? I hardly like the thought of trying anything _risky_. Isn't there something else we can do?" "No." "But surely there must be?" "No. I'd rather not discuss it at the table." "But . . ." He went on firmly spooning soup, trying not to tremble. When he looked up he was caught by a glittering eye across the table, a Mrs. Montefiore, who preferred to be called "Principessa"--a dubious title. "Dolores, don't bother him. We want to hear about his adventures--don't we, Captain?" "No." "Come now! I hear that it was terribly _romantic_." She drawled the word and gave Ellie a sly, sidelong look. She looked back at Max with the eye of a predatory bird and showed her teeth. She seemed to have more teeth than was possible. "Tell us _all_ about it!" "No." "But you simply _can't_ refuse!" Eldreth smiled at her and said, "Princess darling-- your mouth is showing." Mrs. Montefiore shut up. After dinner Max caught Walther alone. "Mr. Walther?" "Oh--yes, Captain?" "Am I correct in thinking that it is my privilege to pick the persons who sit at my table?" "Yes, sir." "In that case--that Montefiore female. Will you have her moved, please? Before breakfast?" Walther smiled faintly. "Aye aye, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre1">21</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE CAPTAIN OF THE ASGARD</p>
<p class="calibre1">They took Sam down and buried him where he had fallen. Max limited it to himself and Walther and Giordano, sending word to Ellie not to come. There was a guard of honor but it was armed to kill and remained spread out around the grave, eyes on the hills. Max read the service in a voice almost too low to be heard--the best he could manage. Engineering had hurriedly prepared the marker, a pointed slab of stainless metal. Max looked at it before he placed it and thought about the inscription. "Greater love hath no man"?--no, he had decided that Sam wouldn't like that, with his cynical contempt of all sentimentality. He had considered, "He played the cards he was dealt"--but that didn't fit Sam either; if Sam didn't like the cards, he sometimes slipped in a whole new deck. No, this was more Sam's style; he shoved it into the ground and read it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT SAM ANDERSON LATE OF THE IMPERIAL MARINES "_He ate what was set before him_."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walther saw the marker for the first time. "So that's how it was? Somehow I thought so." "Yes. I never did know his right name. Richards. Or maybe Roberts." "Oh." Walther thought over the implication. "We could get him reinstated, sir, posthumously. His prints will identify him." "I think Sam would like that." "I'll see to it, sir, when we get back." "_If_ we get back." "If you please, Captain--when we get back." Max went straight to the control room. He had been up the evening before and had gotten the first shock of being treated as captain in the Worry Hole over with. When Kelly greeted him with, "Good morning, Captain," he was able to be almost casual. "Morning, Chief. Morning, Lundy." "Coffee, sir?" "Thanks. About that parking orbit--is it set up?" "Not yet, sir." "Then forget it. I've decided to head straight back. We can plan it as we go. Got the films?" "I picked them up earlier." They referred to the films cached in Max's stateroom. Simes had managed to do away with the first set at the time of Captain Blaine's death; the reserve set was the only record of when and where the _Asgard_ had emerged into this space, including records of routine sights taken immediately after transition. "Okay. Let's get busy. Kovak can punch for me." The others were drifting in, well ahead of time, as was customary in Kelly's gang. "If you wish, sir. I'd be glad to compute for the Captain." "Kovak can do it. You might help Noguchi and Lundy with the films." "Aye aye, sir." Data flowed to him presently. He had awakened twice in the night in cold fright that he had lost his unique memory. But when the data started coming, he programmed without effort, appropriate pages opening in his mind. The problem was a short departure to rid themselves of the planet's influence, an adjustment of position to leave the local sun "behind" for simpler treatment of its field, then a long, straight boost for the neighborhood in which they had first appeared in this space. It need not be precise, for transition would not be attempted on the first pass; they must explore the area, taking many more photographic sights and computing from them, to establish a survey that had never been made. Departure was computed and impressed on tape for the autopilot and the tape placed in the console long before noon. The ship had been keeping house on local time, about fifty-five standard minutes to the hour; now the ship would return to Greenwich, the time always kept in the control room--dinner would be late and some of the "beasts" would as usual reset their watches the wrong way and blame it on the government. They synchronized with the power room, the tape started running, there remained nothing to do but press the button a few seconds before preset time and thereby allow the autopilot to raise ship. The phone rang, Smythe took it and looked at Max. "For you, Captain. The Purser." "Captain?" Samuels sounded worried. "I dislike to disturb you in the control room." "No matter. What is it?" "Mrs. Montefiore. She wants to be landed on Aphrodite." Max thought a moment. "Anybody else change his mind?" "No, sir." "They were all notified to turn in their names last night." "I pointed that out to her, sir. Her answers were not entirely logical." "Nothing would please me more than to dump her there. But after all, we are responsible for her. Tell her no. "Aye aye, sir. May I have a little leeway in how I express it?" "Certainly. Just keep her out of my hair." Max flipped off the phone, found Kelly at his elbow. "Getting close, sir. Perhaps you will take the console now and check the set up? Before you raise?" "Eh? No, you take her up, Chief. You'll have the first watch." "Aye aye, Captain." Kelly sat down at the console, Max took the Captain's seat, feeling self-conscious. He wished that he had learned to smoke a pipe--it looked right to have the Captain sit back, relaxed and smoking his pipe, while the ship maneuvered. He felt a slight pulsation and was pressed more firmly into the chair cushions; the _Asgard_ was again on her own private gravity, independent of true accelerations. Moments later the ship raised, but with nothing to show it but the change out the astrodome from blue sky to star-studded ebony of space. Max got up and found that he was still holding an imaginary pipe, he hastily dropped it. "I'm going below, Chief. Call me when the departure sights are ready to compute. By the way, what rotation of watches do you plan on?" Kelly locked the board, got up and joined him. "Well, Captain. I had figured on Kovak and me heel-and-toe, with the boys on one in three. We'll double up later." Max shook his head. "No. You and me and Kovak. And we'll stay on one in three as long as possible. No telling how long we'll fiddle around out there before we take a stab at it." Kelly lowered his voice. "Captain, may I express an opinion?" "Kelly, any time you stop being frank with me, I won't have a chance of swinging this. You know that." "Thank you, sir. The Captain should not wear himself out. You have to do all the computing as it is." Kelly added quietly, "The safety of your ship is more important than--well, perhaps 'pride' is the word." Max took a long time to reply. He was learning, without the benefit of indoctrination, that a commanding officer is not permitted foibles commonplace in any other role; he himself is ruled more strongly by the powers vested in him than is anyone else. The Captain's privileges--such as chucking a tiresome female from his table--were minor, while the penalties of the inhuman job had unexpected ramifications. "Chief," he said slowly, "is there room to move the coffee mess over behind the computer?" Kelly measured the space with his eye. "Yes, sir. Why?" "I was thinking that would leave room over here to install a cot." "You intend to sleep up here, sir?" "Sometimes. But I was thinking of all of us--you shave up here half the time, as it is. The watches for the next few weeks do not actually require the O.W. to be awake most of the time, so we'll all doss off when we can. What do you think?" "It's against regulations, sir. A bad precedent . . . and a bad example." He glanced over at Noguchi and Smythe. "You would write it up formal and proper, for my signature, citing the regulation and suspending it on an emergency basis 'for the safety of the ship.'" "If you say so, sir." "You don't sound convinced, so maybe I'm wrong. Think it over and let me know." The cot appeared and the order was posted, but Max never saw either Kelly or Kovak stretched out on the cot. As for himself, had he not used it, he would have had little sleep. He usually ate in the control room as well. Although there was little to do on their way out to rendezvous with nothingness but take sights to determine the relations of that nothingness with surrounding sky, Max found that when he was not computing he was worrying, or discussing his worries with Kelly. How did a survey ship find its way back through a newly calculated congruency? And what had gone wrong with those that failed to come back? Perhaps Dr. Hendrix could have figured the other side of an uncharted congruency using only standard ship's equipment--or perhaps not. Max decided that Dr. Hendrix could have done it; the man had been a fanatic about his profession, with a wide knowledge of the theoretical physics behind the routine numerical computations--much wider, Max was sure, than most astrogators. Max knew that survey ships calculated congruencies from both sides, applying to gravitational field theory data gathered on the previously unknown side. He made attempts to rough out such a calculation, then gave up, having no confidence in his results--he was sure of his mathematical operations but unsure of theory and acutely aware of the roughness of his data. There was simply no way to measure accurately the masses of stars light-years away with the instruments in the _Asgard_. Kelly seemed relieved at his decision. After that they both gave all their time to an attempt to lay out a "groove" to the unmarked point in the heavens where their photosights said that they had come out--in order that they might eventually scoot down that groove, arriving at the locus just below the speed of light, then kick her over and hope. A similar maneuver on a planet's surface would be easy--but there is no true parallel with the situation in the sky. The "fixed" stars move at high speeds and there are no other landmarks; to decide what piece of featureless space corresponds with where one was at another time requires a complicated series of calculations having no "elegant" theoretical solutions. For each charted congruency an astrogator has handed to him a table of precalculated solutions--the "Critical Tables for Charted Anomalies." Max and Kelly had to fudge up their own. Max spent so much time in the control room that the First Officer finally suggested that passenger morale would be better if he could show himself in the lounge occasionally. Walther did not add that Max should wear a smile and a look of quiet confidence, but he implied it. Thereafter Max endeavored to dine with his officers and passengers. He had of course seen very little of Eldreth. When he saw her at the first dinner after Walther's gentle suggestion she seemed friendly but distant. He decided that she was treating him with respect, which made him wonder if she were ill. He recalled that she had originally come aboard in a stretcher, perhaps she was not as rugged as she pretended to be. He made a mental note to ask the Surgeon--indirectly, of course! They were dawdling over coffee and Max was beginning to fidget with a desire to get back to the Worry Hole. He reminded himself sharply that Walther expected him not to show anxiety--then looked around and said loudly, "This place is like a morgue. Doesn't anyone dance here these days? Dumont!" "Yes, Captain?" "Let's have some dance music. Mrs. Mendoza, would you honor me?" Mrs. Mendoza tittered and accepted. She turned out to be a disgrace to Argentina, no sense of rhythm. But he piloted her around with only minor collisions and got her back to her chair, so timed that he could bow out gracefully. He then exercised the privilege of rank by cutting in on Mrs. Daigler. Maggie's hair was still short but her splendor otherwise restored. "We've missed you, Captain." "I've been working. Short-handed, you know." "I suppose so. Er . . . Captain, is it pretty soon now?' "Before we transit? Not long. It has taken this long because we have had to do an enormous number of fiddlin' calculations--to be safe, you know." "Are we _really_ going home?" He gave what he hoped was a confident smile. "Absolutely. Don't start any long book from the ship's library; the Purser won't let you take it dirtside." She sighed. "I feel better." He thanked her for the waltz, looked around, saw Mrs. Montefiore and decided that his obligation to maintain morale did not extend that far. Eldreth was seated, so he went to her. "Feet still bothering you, Ellie?" "No, Captain. Thank you for asking." "Then will you dance with me?" She opened her eyes wide. "You mean the Captain has time for po' li'l ole me?" He leaned closer. "One more crack like that, dirty face, and you'll be tossed into irons." She giggled and wrinkled her nose. "Aye aye, Captain, sir." For a while they danced without talking, with Max a little overpowered by her nearness and wondering why he had not done this sooner. Finally she said, "Max? Have you given up three-dee permanently?" "Huh? Not at all. After we make this transit I'll have time to play--if you'll spot me two starships." "I'm sorry I ever told you about that. But I do wish you would say hello to Chipsie sometimes. She was asking this morning, 'Where Maxie?'" "Oh, I _am_ sorry. I'd take her up to the control room with me occasionally, except that she might push a button and lose us a month's work. Go fetch her." "The crowd would make her nervous. We'll go see her." He shook his head. "Not to your room." "Huh? Don't be silly. I've got no reputation left anyhow, and a captain can do as he pleases." "That shows you've never been a captain. See that vulture watching us?" He indicated Mrs. Montefiore with his eyes. "Now go get Chipsie and no more of your back talk." "Aye aye, Captain." He scratched Chipsie's chin, fed her sugar cubes, and assured her that she was the finest spider puppy in that part of the sky. He then excused himself. He was feeling exhilarated and oddly reassured. Seeing Mr. Walther disappearing into his room, he paused at the companionway and on impulse followed him. A matter had been worrying him, this was as good a time as any. "Dutch? Are you busy?" The First Officer turned. "Oh. No, Captain. Come in." Max waited during the ceremonial coffee, then broached it. "Something on my mind, Mr. Walther--a personal matter." "Anything I can do?" "I don't think so. But you're a lot more experienced than I am; I'd like to tell you about it." "If the Captain wishes." "Look, Dutch, this is a 'Max' matter, not a 'Captain' matter." Walther smiled. "All right. But don't ask me to change my form of address. I might pick up a bad habit." "Okay, okay." Max had intended to sound out Walther about his phony record: had Dr. Hendrix reported it? Or hadn't he? But he found it impossible to follow that line; being a captain had forced him into a different mold. "I want to tell you how I got into this ship." He told it all, not suppressing Sam's part now that it no longer could hurt Sam. Walther listened gravely. "I've been waiting for you to mention this, Captain," he said at last. "Dr. Hendrix reported it to me, in less detail, when he put you up for apprentice astrogator. We agreed that it was a matter that need not be raised inside the ship." "It's what happens after we get back that frets me. If we get back." "When we get back. Are you asking for advice? Or help? Or what?" "I don't know. I just wanted to tell you." "Mmmm . . . there are two alternatives. One we could handle here, by altering a not very important report. In which . . ." "No, Dutch. I won't have phony reports going out of the _Asgard_." "I was fairly certain you would say that. I feel the same way, except that I would feel obligated for-- well, various reasons--to cover up for you if you asked it." "I once intended to arrange a phony on it. I even felt justified. But I can't do it now." "I understand. The remaining alternative is to report it and face the music. In which case I'll see it through with you--and so will the Chief Engineer and the Purser, I feel sure." Max sat back, feeling warm and happy. "Thanks, Dutch. I don't care what they do to me . . . just as long as it doesn't keep me out of space." "I don't think they'll try to do that, not if you bring this ship in. But if they do--well, they'll know they've been in a fight. Meantime try to forget it." "I'll try." Max frowned. "Dutch? Tell me the truth, what do _you_ think about the stunt I pulled?" "That's a hard question, Captain. More important is, how do you feel about it?" "Me? I don't know. I know how I used to feel--I felt belligerent." "Eh?" "I was always explaining--in my mind of course-- why I did it, justifying myself, pointing out that the system was at fault, not me. Now I don't want to justify myself. Not that I regret it, not when I think what I would have missed. But I don't want to duck out of paying for it, either." Walther nodded. "That sounds like a healthy attitude. Captain, no code is perfect. A man must conform with judgment and commonsense, not with blind obedience. I've broken rules; some violations I paid for, some I didn't. This mistake you made could have turned you into a moralistic prig, a 'Regulation Charlie' determined to walk the straight and narrow and to see that everyone else obeyed the letter of the law. Or it could have made you a permanent infant who thinks rules are for everyone but him. It doesn't seem to have had either effect; I think it has matured you." Max grinned. "Well, thanks, Dutch." He stood up. "I'll get back up to the Hole and mess up a few figures." "Captain? Are you getting enough sleep?" "Me? Oh, sure, I get a nap almost every watch."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Minus four hours, Captain." Max sat up on the cot in the control room, rubbing sleep out of his eyes. The _Asgard_ was in the groove, had been boosting along it for days, working up to that final burst that would squeeze them out of this space and into another--one they knew or some other, depending on how well their "fudging" had conformed to the true structure of the universe. Max blinked at Kelly. "How long have you been up here?" "Not long, Captain." "Did you get _any_ sleep?" "Well, now, Captain . . ." "Forget it, you're incorrigible. Got one ready?" "Yes, sir." "Shoot." Max sat on the cot while they passed data to him, eyes closed while he programmed the problem and translated it into the binary numbers the computer understood. He had not been out of the Hole more than a few minutes at a time for days. He would doze between sights, wake up and process one, then lie down again. He had kept Kelly and Kovak on watch-and-watch as long as possible--although it was hard to get Kelly to rest. Lundy, Smythe, and Noguchi had continued to rotate, overlapping when the going got faster in order to help each other with plate changing and readings. For Max there could be no relief; he must process each sight, supplying from his card-file memory the information in the missing manuals. All the Worry gang were there but Lundy. He came up as Max finished and ordered the correction. "Compliments of cookie," he announced, setting down a gallon of ice cream. "What flavor?" asked Max. "Chocolate chip, sir." "My favorite. Just remember when you are dishing it that efficiency marks will be coming up one of these days." "Now, Captain, that's not fair. The Chief has a lot more mass to feed than you have." "And I have a very high metabolic rate," announced Noguchi. "I need more." "Noggy, you have a built-in space warp in each leg. We'll let Kelly dish it and hope that pride will restrain him." Max turned to Kelly. "What schedule are we on?" "Twenty minutes, Captain." "Think we need that so soon?" "Just to be safe, sir." "Okay." They ran another sight and ate the ice cream, after which Max shifted them to transition stations. Kelly did not take the computer. A key punched by Kovak gave the same answer as one punched by Kelly, and Max wanted Kelly on the vernier stereograph where his long experience could make the best of poor data. Lundy assisted Kelly, with Smythe and Noguchi shooting and running. At minus two hours Max called Compagnon, told him that they were narrowing down; the Chief Engineer assured him that he would nurse boost and vector himself from there on. "Good hunting, Captain." On a ten minute schedule Max still found it easy, though he had to admit he wasn't as fresh as a still-warm egg. But he was kept comfortably busy and the corrections were pleasantly small--Compagnon must be doing a real job down there. When the preset on the computer said less than one hour to zero, he stood up and stretched. "Everybody all set. Somebody wake up Noggy. Everybody got a pepper pill in him? And who's got one for me?" Kovak leaned back and handed him one, Max popped it into his mouth and downed it with a swig of coffee. "Grab a last sandwich if you're going to. All right, gang--let's hit it!" The data flowed in a steady stream. After a while Max began to tire. He would no more than pick one correction off the lights on the computer and feed it to the power room than Kelly would have more data ready. A correction showed up that seemed off the curve, as if they were "hunting" excessively. He glanced back at the lights before applying it--then realized that a new set of data was being offered. "Repeat!" he called out. Kelly repeated. Max ran the figures over in his mind and found that they meant nothing to him. What had that last correction implied? Had he used a legitimate method in surveying this anomaly? Could you even call it surveying? Was this what a survey ship did to get out? How could they expect a man to. . . . "Captain!" Kelly said sharply. He shook his head and sat up. "Sorry. Hold the next one." With a feeling of panic he reviewed the data in his mind and tried to program. He knew at last how it felt to have the deadline bearing down fast as light-- and to lose confidence. He told himself that he must abort--slide past under the speed of light, spend weeks swinging back, and try again. But he knew that if he did, his nerve would never sustain him for a second try. At that bad moment a feeling came over him that someone was standing behind his chair, resting hands on his shoulders--quieting him, soothing him. He began clearly and sharply to call off figures to Kovak. He was still calling them out with the precision of an automaton twenty minutes later. He accepted one more sight, digested it, sent it on to Kovak with his eyes on the preset. He applied the correction, a tiny one, and called out, "Stand by!" He pressed the button that allowed the chronometer to kick it over on the microsecond. Only then did he look around, but there was no one behind him. "There's the Jeep!" he heard Kelly say exultantly. "And there's the Ugly Duckling!" Max looked up. They were back in the familiar sky of Nu Pegasi and Halcyon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five minutes later Kelly and Max were drinking cold coffee and cleaning up the remains of a plate of sandwiches while Noguchi and Smythe completed the post-transition sights. Kovak and Lundy had gone below for a few minutes relief before taking the first watch. Max glanced again at the astrodome. "So we made it. I never thought we would." "Really, Captain? There was never any doubt in my mind after you took command." "Hmmm! I'm glad you didn't know how I felt." Kelly ignored this. "You know, sir, when you are programming your voice sounds amazingly like the Doctor's." Max looked at him sharply. "I had a bad time there once," he said slowly. "Shortly before zip." "Yes, sir. I know." "Then-- Look, this was just a _feeling_, you see? I don't go for ghosts. But I had the notion that Doc was standing over me, the way he used to, checking what I did. Then everything was all right." Kelly nodded. "Yes. He was here. I was sure he would be." "Huh? What do you mean?" Kelly would not explain. He turned instead to inspect post-transition plates, comparing them happily with standard plates from the chart safe--the first such opportunity since the ship was lost. "I suppose," said Max when Kelly was through, "that we had better rough out an orbit for Nu Pegasi before we sack in." He yawned. "Brother, am I dead!" Kelly said, "For Nu Pegasi, sir?" "Well, we can't shoot for Halcyon itself at this distance. What did you have in mind?" "Nothing, sir." "Spill it." "Well, sir, I guess I had assumed that we would reposition for transit to Nova Terra. But if that is what the Captain wants--" Max drummed on the chart safe. It had never occurred to him that anyone would expect him to do anything, after accomplishing the impossible, but to shape course for the easy, target-in-sight destination they had left from, there to wait for competent relief. "You expected me to take her on through? With no tables and no help?" "I did not intend to presume, Captain. It was an unconscious assumption." Max straightened up. "Tell Kovak to hold her as she goes. Phone Mr. Walther to see me at once in my cabin." "Aye aye, sir." The First Officer met him outside his cabin. "Hello, Dutch. Come in." They entered and Max threw his cap on his desk. "Well, we made it." "Yes, sir. I was watching from the lounge." "You don't seem surprised." "Should I be, Captain?" Max sprawled in his easy chair, stretching his weary back muscles. "You should be. Yes, sir, you should be." "All right. I'm surprised." Max looked up and scowled. "Dutch, where is this ship going now?" Walther answered, "The Captain has not yet told me." "Confound it! You know what I mean. Our schedule calls for Nova Terra. But there is Halcyon sitting right over there--a blind man could find it with a cane. What destination did you have in mind when you boosted me into command? Tell me what you expected then? Before you tagged me." "I had in mind," Walther answered, "getting a captain for the _Asgard_." "That's no answer. See here, the passengers have a stake in this. Sure, I had to take this risk for them, no choice. But now there is a choice. Shouldn't we tell them and let them vote on it?" Walther shook his head emphatically. "You don't ask passengers anything, sir. Not in a ship underway. It is not fair to them to ask them. You _tell_ them." Max jumped up and strode the length of the cabin. "'Fair,' you say. Fair! It's not fair to _me_." He swung and faced Walther. "Well? You're not a passenger. You're my First Officer. What do you think we should do?" Walther stared him in the eye. "I can't decide that for the Captain. That is why you are Captain." Max stood still and closed his eyes. The figures stood out clearly, in neat columns. He went to his phone and savagely punched the call for the control room. "Captain speaking. Is Kelly still there? Oh-- good, Chief. We reposition for Nova Terra. Start work--I'll be up in a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre1">22</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE TOMAHAWK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max liked this time of day, this time of year. He was lying in the grass on the little rise west of the barn, with his head propped up so that he could see to the northwest. If he kept his eyes there, on the exit ring of the C.S.&amp;E. Ring Road, he would be able, any instant now, to see the _Tomahawk_ plunge out and shoot across the gap in free trajectory. At the moment he was not reading, no work was pushing him, he was just being lazy and enjoying the summer evening. A squirrel sat up near by, stared at him, decided he was harmless and went about its business. A bird swooped past. There was a breathless hush, then suddenly a silver projectile burst out of the exit ring, plunged across the draw and entered the ring on the far side--just as the sound hit him. "Boy, oh boy!" he said softly. "It never looks like they'd make it." It was all that he had climbed the rise to see, but he did not get up at once. Instead he pulled a letter from his pocket and reread the ending: ". . . I guess Daddy was glad to get me back in one piece because he finally relented. Putzie and I were married a week ago-- and oh Max, I'm so _happy!_ You must visit us the next time you hit dirt at Hespera." She had added, "P.S. Mr. Chips sends her love--and so do I." Quite a gal, Ellie. She usually got her own way, one way or another. He felt a bit sorry for Putzie. Now if they had all stayed on Charity . . . Never mind--an astrogator ought not to get married. Fondly he fingered the sunburst on his chest. Too bad he had not been able to stay with the _Asgard_-- but of course they were right; he could not ship as assistant in a ship where he had once been skipper. And assistant astrogator of the _Elizabeth Regina_ was a good billet, too; everybody said the _Lizzie_ was a taut ship. Besides that, not every young A.A. had a new congruency to his credit, even now being surveyed. He had nothing to kick about. He didn't even mind the whopping big fine the Council of the Guilds had slapped on him, nor the official admonition that had been entered in his record. They had let him stay in space, which was the important thing, and the admonition appeared right along with the official credit for the "Hendrix" congruency. And, while he didn't argue the justice of the punishment--he'd been in the wrong and he knew it--nevertheless the guilds were set up wrong; the rules ought to give everybody a chance. Some day he'd be senior enough to do a little politicking on that point. In the meantime, if he didn't get moving, he'd have to buy that taxi. Max got up and started down the slope. The helicab was parked in front of the house and the driver was standing near it, looking out over the great raw gash of the Missouri-Arkansas Power Project. The fields Max once had worked were gone, the cut reached clear into the barn yard. The house was still standing but the door hung by one hinge and some kid had broken all the windows. Max looked at the house and wondered where Maw and the man she had married were now?--not that he really cared and no one around Clyde's Corners seemed to know. They had told him at the courthouse that Maw had collected her half of the government-condemnation money and the pair of them had left town. Probably their money was gone by now--Max's half of the money was gone completely, it hadn't quite paid his fine. If they were broke, maybe Montgomery was having to do some honest work, for Maw wasn't the woman to let a man loaf when she was needing. The thought pleased Max; he felt he had a score to settle with Montgomery, but Maw was probably settling it for him. The driver turned toward him. "Be a big thing when they get this finished. You ready to go, sir?" Max took a last glance around. "Yes. I'm all through here." They climbed into the cabin. "Where to? Back to the Corners?" Max thought about it. He really ought to save money--but shucks, he would save plenty this next trip. "No, fly me over to Springfield and drop me at the southbound ring road station. I'd like to make it in time to catch the _Javelin_." That would put him in Earthport before morning.</p>
